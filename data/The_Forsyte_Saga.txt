''The Man of Property'', the first book, was adapted in 1949 by Hollywood as ''That Forsyte Woman'', starring Errol Flynn, Greer Garson, Walter Pidgeon, and Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young. In 1967 the BBC produced a The Forsyte Saga (1967 series)|popular 26-part serial that dramatised ''The Forsyte Saga'' and the subsequent trilogy concerning the Forsytes, ''A Modern Comedy''. In 2002 Granada Television produced two series for the ITV (TV network)|ITV network, ''The Forsyte Saga (2002 miniseries)|The Forsyte Saga'' and ''The Forsyte Saga: To Let (2003 miniseries)|The Forsyte Saga: To Let'', and both made runs in the U.S. as parts of ''Masterpiece Theatre''. In 2003 ''The Forsyte Saga'' was listed as #123 on the BBC's The Big Read poll of the UK's  " best-loved novel " .  [  " BBC – The Big Read " ]. April 2003, Retrieved 31 October 2012.

 ==Books== 
 
 ===''The Man of Property'' (1906)=== 
 In this first novel of the ''Forsyte Saga'', after introducing us to the impressive array of Forsytes headed by the formidable Aunt Ann, Galsworthy moves into the main action of the saga by detailing Soames Forsyte's desire to own things, including his beautiful wife, Irene Forsyte (née Heron). He is jealous of her friendships and wants her to be his alone. He concocts a plan to move her to a house he is having built at Robin Hill, away from everyone she knows and cares for. She resists his grasping intentions, and falls in love with the architect Philip Bosinney, who has been engaged by Soames to build the house. Bosinney returns her love, although he is the fiancé of her young friend June Forsyte, the daughter of Soames's estranged cousin  " Young "  Jolyon. There is no happy ending: Irene leaves Soames after he asserts what he perceives to be his ultimate right on his property by raping her, and Bosinney dies under the wheels of a bus after being driven frantic by the news of the rape. 
 
 ===  " Indian Summer of a Forsyte "  (1918)=== 
 In a short interlude after ''The Man of Property'' Galsworthy delves into the newfound friendship between Irene and Old Jolyon Forsyte (June's grandfather, now the owner of the house Soames had built). This attachment gives Old Jolyon pleasure, but exhausts his strength. He leaves Irene money in his will, with Young Jolyon, his son, as trustee. In the end Old Jolyon dies under an ancient oak tree in the garden of the Robin Hill house. 
 
 ===''In Chancery'' (1920)=== 
 The marital discord of both Soames and his sister Winifred is the subject of the second novel (the title refers to the Court of Chancery, which dealt with domestic issues). They take steps to divorce their spouses, Irene and Montague Dartie respectively. However, while Soames tells his sister to brave the consequences of going to court, he is unwilling to go through a divorce. Instead he stalks and hounds Irene, follows her abroad, and asks her to have his child, which was his father's wish. 
 
 Irene inherits £15,000 after Old Jolyon's death. His son, Young Jolyon Forsyte, also Soames's cousin, manages Irene's finances. When she first leaves Soames, Young Jolyon offers his support. By the time his son Jolly dies in the South African War, Irene has developed a strong friendship with Jolyon. Then Soames confronts young Jolyon and Irene at Robin Hill, falsely accusing them of having an affair. Young Jolyon and Irene assert that they have had an affair because Soames has it in his mind already. This statement gives Soames the evidence he needs for divorce proceedings. That confrontation sparks an eventual consummation between young Jolyon and Irene, leading to their marriage once the divorce is final and the birth of a son Jolyon  " Jon "  Forsyte. Soames marries Annette, the young daughter of a French Soho restaurant owner. With his new wife, he has his only child, a daughter named Fleur Forsyte. 
 
 === " Awakening "  (1920)=== 
 The subject of the second interlude is the naive and exuberant lifestyle of eight-year-old Jon Forsyte. He loves and is loved by his parents. He has an idyllic youth, and his every desire indulged. 
 
 ===''To Let'' (1921)=== 
 This novel concludes the Forsyte Saga. Second cousins Fleur and Jon Forsyte meet and fall in love, ignorant of their parents' past troubles, indiscretions and misdeeds. Once Soames, Jolyon, and Irene discover their romance, they forbid their children to see each other again. Irene and Jolyon also fear that Fleur is too much like her father, and once she has Jon in her grasp, will want to possess him entirely. Despite her feelings for Jon, Fleur has a very suitable suitor, Michael Mont, heir to a baronetcy, who has fallen in love with her. If they marry, Fleur would elevate the status of her family from nouveau riche to the aristocratic upper class. The title derives from Soames' reflections as he breaks up the house in which his Uncle Timothy, recently deceased in 1920 at age 101 and the last of the older generation of Forsytes, had lived a recluse, hoarding his life like property.  
 
 Knowing he is soon to die from a weak heart, Jolyon writes a letter to Jon, detailing the events of Irene's marriage to Soames, including her love affair with Philip Bosinney and Soames's rape of her and warns him that Irene would be alone if he were to marry Fleur. But while Jon reads the letter, Jolyon suddenly dies of a heart attack, and Jon is left torn between the past and his present love for Fleur. He ultimately rejects Fleur, breaking his own heart as well as hers, and leaves for Canada. Fleur marries Michael Mont, though she knows she doesn't love him. With her marriage, Soames is separated from the only person whom he has truly loved. Irene also leaves for Canada, selling the house at Robin Hill. Soames and Irene briefly exchange glances at a distance and a kind of peace is made between them, but Soames is left contemplating all that he never really had but tried to possess.

 ==== Radio adaptations ==== 
 There have been various BBC radio dramatisations. The first was probably a radio production of ''The Man of Property''  in 11 weekly parts commencing 9 December 1945 on the BBC Home Service. The music used as the opening and closing theme came from Edward Elgar's ''Enigma Variations'', specifically the ''Nimrod'' variation. This adaptation starred Leo Genn as Jo, Grizelda Hervey as Irene and Ronald Simpson as Soames.  It was adapted by Muriel Levy and produced by Val Gielgud and Felix Felton. Young Jolyons in later adaptations included Andrew Cruickshank, Leo Genn and Guy Rolfe. Another production of the dramatised cycle came soon after the 1967 TV series, which had Rachel Gurney as Irene, Noel Johnson as Young Jolyon and Alan Wheatley as Soames. The version broadcast in 1990 comprised a 75-minute opening episode followed by 22 hour-long episodes, entitled ''The Forsyte Chronicles''. It was the most expensive radio drama serial ever broadcast, due to its length and its big-name cast, which included Dirk Bogarde, Diana Quick, Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams and Alan Howard. This radio series was rerun on BBC 7 radio in 2004, and has been released commercially. 
 
 In January 2016, BBC Radio 4 began broadcasting a new radio adaptation by Shaun McKenna and Lin Coghlan under the title ''The Forsytes'', scheduled to continue until late 2017. The cast was led by Joseph Millson as Soames, Jessica Raine as Fleur, Juliet Aubrey as Irene, Harry Haddon Paton as Bosinney and Ewan Bailey as Young Jolyon.  It was directed by Marion Nancarrow and Gemma Jenkins.

 ==Themes== 
 Duty versus Desire: Young Jolyon was the favourite of the family until he left his wife for his daughter's governess. He eschews his status in society and in the Forsyte clan to follow his heart. Soames, though it seems he is the polar opposite of Jolyon, has those same inclinations toward doing what he desires. For example, instead of finding a wife who is rich, he marries Irene and then Annette, who have neither money nor status. When he takes Irene to a play about a married woman and her lover, he ironically sympathizes with the lover and not the husband. However, most of his decisions are on the side of duty. 
 
 Generations and Change: The many generations of the Forsyte clan remind everyone of what has come to pass over the years. However, as the old ranks begin to die, people are able to change. For example, after a few generations, the fact that they are nouveau riche does not matter as much. This is also the case with Soames and Irene's marital problems. Once they grow old and their children can overcome their parents' past, Soames can finally let go of the past. Another change with generations is the diminished number of Forsyte offspring.  Many of the second generation have fewer children. 
 
 ==Sequels== 
 
 File:Forsyte Chronicles Diagram.svg|thumb|Works within the Forsyte Chronicles 
 
 Galsworthy's sequel to ''The Forsyte Saga'' came in ''A Modern Comedy'', written in the years 1924 to 1928. This comprises the novel ''The White Monkey''; an interlude, ''A Silent Wooing''; a second novel, ''The Silver Spoon''; a second interlude, ''Passers By''; and a third novel, ''Swan Song''. The principal characters are Soames and Fleur, and the second saga ends with the death of Soames in 1926. This is also the point reached at the end of the 1967 television series. 
 
 Galsworthy wrote one further trilogy, ''End of the Chapter'', comprising ''Maid in Waiting'', ''Flowering Wilderness'', and ''Over the River'' (also known as ''One More River''), chiefly dealing with Michael Mont's young cousin, Dinny Cherrell.  
 
 The three trilogies have been republished under the collective title of ''The Forsyte Chronicles''. 
 
 In 1930 Galsworthy published ''On Forsyte 'Change'', which deals in the main with the older Forsytes before the events chronicled in ''The Man of Property''. Galsworthy states in a foreword that  " They have all been written since ''Swan Song'' was finished but in place they come between the Saga and the Comedy ... "  By way of explanation he writes that  " It is hard to part suddenly and finally from those with whom one has lived so long; and these footnotes do really, I think, help to fill in and round out the chronicles of the Forsyte family.
