 ''Moby-Dick; or, The Whale'' is an 1851 novel by American writer Herman Melville. The book is the sailor Ishmael (Moby-Dick)|Ishmael's narrative of the obsessive quest of Captain Ahab|Ahab, captain of the whaler|whaling ship ''Pequod (Moby-Dick)|Pequod'', for revenge on Moby Dick (whale)|Moby Dick, the giant white sperm whale that on the ship's previous voyage bit off Ahab's leg at the knee. A contribution to the literature of the American Renaissance (literature)|American Renaissance, ''Moby-Dick'' was published to mixed reviews, was a commercial failure, and was out of print at the time of the author's death in 1891. Its reputation as a  " Great American Novel "  was established only in the 20th century, after the centennial of its author's birth. William Faulkner said he wished he had written the book himself,  Faulkner (1927)   and D. H. Lawrence called it  " one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world "  and  " the greatest book of the sea ever written " .  Lawrence (1923), 168   Its opening sentence,  " Call me Ishmael " , is among world literature's most famous.   Buell (2014), 362 note.  
 
 Melville began writing ''Moby-Dick'' in February 1850, and finished 18 months later, a year longer than he had anticipated. Melville drew on his experience as a common sailor from 1841 to 1844, including several years on whalers, and on wide reading in whaling literature. The white whale is modeled on the notoriously hard-to-catch albino whale Mocha Dick, and the book's ending is based on the sinking of the whaleship ''Essex (whaleship)|Essex'' in 1820. His literary influences include William Shakespeare|Shakespeare and the Bible. The detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and of extracting whale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, are mixed with exploration of Social class in the United States|class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of God. In addition to narrative prose, Melville uses styles and literary devices ranging from songs, poetry, and catalogs to Shakespearean stage directions, soliloquy|soliloquies, and asides. In August 1850, with the manuscript perhaps half finished, he met Nathaniel Hawthorne and was deeply moved by his ''Mosses from an Old Manse'', which he compared to Shakespeare in its cosmic ambitions. This encounter may have inspired him to revise and expand ''Moby-Dick'', which is dedicated to Hawthorne,  " in token of my admiration for his genius " . 
 
 The book was first published (in three volumes) as ''The Whale'' in London in October 1851, and under its definitive title in a single-volume edition in New York in November. The London publisher, Richard Bentley (publisher)|Richard Bentley, censored or changed sensitive passages; Melville made revisions as well, including a last-minute change to the title for the New York edition. The whale, however, appears in the text of both editions as  " Moby Dick " , without the hyphen.  Tanselle (1988)  " Editorial Appendix, "  810–12   Reviewers in Britain were largely favorable,  Parker (1988), 702   though some objected that the tale seemed to be told by a narrator who perished with the ship, as the British edition lacked the Epilogue recounting Ishmael's survival. American reviewers were more hostile.  Parker (1988), 721–722   About 3,200 copies of the book were sold during the author's life.  
 
 ==Plot== 
  
  
 Ishmael (Moby-Dick)|Ishmael travels in December from Manhattan Island to New Bedford, Massachusetts, with plans to sign up for a whaling voyage. The inn where he arrives is overcrowded, so he must share a bed with the tattooed cannibal Polynesian Queequeg, a harpooneer whose father was king of the fictional island of Rokovoko. The next morning, Ishmael and Queequeg attend Father Mapple's sermon on Book of Jonah|Jonah, then head for Nantucket, Massachusetts|Nantucket. Ishmael signs up with the Quaker ship-owners Captain Bildad|Bildad and Captain Peleg|Peleg for a voyage on their whaler ''Pequod (Moby-Dick)|Pequod''. Peleg describes Captain Ahab:  " He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man "  who nevertheless  " has his humanities " . They hire Queequeg the following morning. A man named Elijah prophesies a dire fate should Ishmael and Queequeg join Ahab. While provisions are loaded, shadowy figures board the ship. On a cold Christmas Day, the ''Pequod'' leaves the harbor. 
 
 Ishmael discusses Cetology of Moby-Dick|cetology (the zoological classification and natural history of the whale), and describes the crew members. The chief mate is 30-year-old List of Moby-Dick characters#Crewmates|Starbuck, a Nantucket Quaker with a realist mentality, whose harpooneer is Queequeg; second mate is List of Moby-Dick characters#Crewmates|Stubb, from Cape Cod, happy-go-lucky and cheerful, whose harpooneer is Tashtego, a proud, pure-blooded Indian from Gay Head; and the third mate is List of Moby-Dick characters#Crewmates|Flask, also from Martha's Vineyard, short, stout, whose harpooneer is List of Moby-Dick characters#Harpooneers|Daggoo, a tall African, now a resident of Nantucket. 
 
 When Ahab finally appears on the quarterdeck, he announces he is out for revenge on the white whale which took one leg from the knee down and left him with a prosthesis fashioned from a whale's jawbone. Ahab will give the first man to sight Moby Dick a doubloon, a gold coin, which he nails to the mast. Starbuck objects that he has not come for vengeance but for profit. Ahab's purpose exercises a mysterious spell on Ishmael:  " Ahab's quenchless feud seemed mine " . Instead of rounding Cape Horn, Ahab heads for the equatorial Pacific Ocean via southern Africa. One afternoon, as Ishmael and Queequeg are weaving a mat —  " its warp seemed necessity, his hand free will, and Queequeg's sword chance "  — Tashtego sights a sperm whale. Five previously unknown men appear on deck and are revealed to be a special crew selected by Ahab and explain the shadowy figures seen boarding the ship. Their leader, List of Moby-Dick characters#Harpooneers|Fedallah, a Parsi|Parsee, is Ahab's harpooneer. The pursuit is unsuccessful. 
 
 File:Moby Dick p510 illustration.jpg|thumb|upright|Moby Dick attacking a whaling boat 
 Southeast of the Cape of Good Hope, the ''Pequod'' makes the first of nine sea-encounters, or  " Gam (nautical term)|gams " , with other ships: Ahab hails the ''Goney'' (Albatross) to ask whether they have seen the White Whale, but the trumpet through which her captain tries to speak falls into the sea before he can answer. Ishmael explains that because of Ahab's absorption with Moby Dick, he sails on without the customary  " gam " , which Ishmael defines as a  " social meeting of two (or more) Whale-ships " , in which the two captains remain on one ship and the chief mates on the other. In the second gam off the Cape of Good Hope, with the ''Town-Ho'', a Nantucket whaler, the concealed story of a  " judgment of God "  is revealed, but only to the crew: a defiant sailor who struck an oppressive officer is flogged, and when that officer led the chase for Moby Dick, he fell from the boat and was killed by the whale. 
 
 Ishmael digresses on pictures of whales, brit (microscopic sea creatures on which whales feed), squid and— after four boats are lowered in vain because Daggoo mistook a giant squid for the white whale— whale-lines. The next day, in the Indian Ocean, Stubb kills a sperm whale, and that night Fleece, the ''Pequod''s black cook, prepares him a rare whale steak. Fleece, at Stubb's request, delivers a sermon to the sharks that fight each other to feast on the whale's carcass, tied to the ship, saying that their nature is to be voracious, but they must overcome it. The whale is prepared, beheaded, and barrels of oil are tried out. Standing at the head of the whale, Ahab begs it to speak of the depths of the sea. The ''Pequod'' next encounters the ''Jeroboam'', which not only lost its chief mate to Moby Dick, but also is now plagued by an epidemic. 
 
 The whale carcass still lies in the water. Queequeg mounts it, tied to Ishmael's belt by a monkey-rope as if they were Conjoined twins|Siamese twins. Stubb and Flask kill a right whale whose head is fastened to a yardarm opposite the sperm whale's head. Ishmael compares the two heads in a philosophical way: the right whale is John Locke|Lockean, Stoicism|stoic, and the sperm whale is Immanuel Kant|Kantean, platonic. Tashtego cuts into the head of the sperm whale and retrieves buckets of spermaceti. He falls into the head, which in turn falls off the yardarm into the sea. Queequeg dives after him and frees his mate with his sword. 
 
 The ''Pequod'' next gams with the ''Jungfrau'' from Bremen. Both ships sight whales simultaneously, with the ''Pequod'' winning the contest. The three harpooneers dart their harpoons, and Flask delivers the mortal strike with a lance. The carcass sinks, and Queequeg barely manages to escape. The ''Pequod''s next gam is with the French whaler ''Bouton de Rose'', whose crew is ignorant of the ambergris in the gut of the diseased whale in their possession. Stubb talks them out of it, but Ahab orders him away before he can recover more than a few handfuls. Days later, an encounter with a harpooned whale prompts Pip, a little black cabin-boy from Connecticut, to jump out of his whale boat. The whale must be cut loose, because the line has Pip so entangled in it. Furious, Stubb orders Pip to stay in the whale boat, but Pip later jumps again, and is left alone in the immense sea and has gone insane by the time he is picked up. 
 
 Cooled spermaceti congeals and must be squeezed back into liquid state; blubber is boiled in the try-pots on deck; the warm oil is decanted into casks, and then stowed in the ship. After the operation, the decks are scrubbed. The coin hammered to the main mast shows three Andes summits, one with a flame, one with a tower, and one a crowing cock. Ahab stops to look at the doubloon and interprets the coin as signs of his firmness, volcanic energy, and victory; Starbuck takes the high peaks as evidence of the Trinity; Stubb focuses on the zodiacal arch over the mountains; and Flask sees nothing of any symbolic value at all. The Manxman mutters in front of the mast, and Pip declines the verb  " look " . 
 
 File:Queequeg.JPG|thumb|upright|Queequeg, as illustrated in a 1902 edition 
 
 The ''Pequod'' next gams with the ''Samuel Enderby'' of London, captained by Boomer, a down-to-earth fellow who lost his right arm to Moby Dick. Nevertheless, he carries no ill will toward the whale, which he regards not as malicious, but as awkward. Ahab puts an end to the gam by rushing back to his ship. The narrator now discusses the subjects of (1) whalers supply; (2) a glen in Tranque in the Arsacides islands full of carved whale bones, fossil whales, whale skeleton measurements; (3) the chance that the magnitude of the whale will diminish and that the leviathan might perish. 
 
 Leaving the ''Samuel Enderby'', Ahab wrenches his ivory leg and orders the carpenter to fashion him another. Starbuck informs Ahab of oil leakage in the hold. Reluctantly, Ahab orders the harpooneers to inspect the casks. Queequeg, sweating all day below decks, develops a chill and soon is almost mortally feverish. The carpenter makes a coffin for Queequeg, who fears an ordinary burial at sea. Queequeg tries it for size, with Pip sobbing and beating his tambourine, standing by and calling himself a coward while he praises Queequeg for his gameness. Yet Queequeg suddenly rallies, briefly convalesces, and leaps up, back in good health. Henceforth, he uses his coffin for a spare seachest, which is later caulked and pitched to replace the ''Pequod''s life buoy. 
 
 The ''Pequod'' sails northeast toward Formosa and into the Pacific Ocean. Ahab, with one nostril, smells the musk from the Philippines|Bashee isles, and with the other, the salt of the waters where Moby Dick swims. Ahab goes to Perth, the blacksmith, with a bag of racehorse shoenail stubs to be forged into the shank of a special harpoon, and with his razors for Perth to melt and fashion into a harpoon barb. Ahab tempers the barb in blood from Queequeg, Tashtego, and Daggoo. 
 
 The ''Pequod'' gams next with the ''Bachelor'', a Nantucket ship heading home full of sperm oil. Every now and then, the ''Pequod'' lowers for whales with success. On one of those nights in the whaleboat, Fedallah prophesies that neither hearse nor coffin can be Ahab's, that before he dies, Ahab must see two hearses — one not made by mortal hands and the other made of American wood — that Fedallah will precede his captain in death, and finally that only hemp can kill Ahab. 
 
 As the ''Pequod'' approaches the Equator, Ahab scolds his quadrant for telling him only where he is and not where he will be. He dashes it to the deck. That evening, an impressive typhoon attacks the ship. Lightning strikes the mast, setting the doubloon and Ahab's harpoon aglow. Ahab delivers a speech on the spirit of fire, seeing the lightning as a portent of Moby Dick. Starbuck sees the lightning as a warning, and feels tempted to shoot the sleeping Ahab with a musket. The next morning, when he finds that the lightning disoriented the compass, Ahab makes a new one out of a lance, a maul, and a sailmaker's needle. He orders the Chip log|log be heaved, but the weathered line snaps, leaving the ship with no way to fix its location. 
 
 File:Moby Dick final chase.jpg|thumb|upright|Moby Dick, as illustrated in a 1902 edition 
 The ''Pequod'' is now heading southeast toward Moby Dick. A man falls overboard from the mast. The life buoy is thrown, but both sink. Now Queequeg proposes that his superfluous coffin be used as a new life buoy. Starbuck orders the carpenter to seal and waterproof it. The next morning, the ship meets in another truncated gam with the ''Rachel'', commanded by Captain Gardiner from Nantucket. The ''Rachel'' is seeking survivors from one of her whaleboats which had gone after Moby Dick. Among the missing is Gardiner's young son. Ahab refuses to join the search. 
 
 Twenty-four hours a day, Ahab now stands and walks the deck, while Fedallah shadows him. Suddenly, a sea hawk grabs Ahab's slouched hat and flies off with it. Next, the ''Pequod'', in a ninth and final gam, meets the ''Delight'', badly damaged and with five of her crew left dead by Moby Dick. Her captain shouts that the harpoon which can kill the white whale has yet to be forged, but Ahab flourishes his special lance and once more orders the ship forward. Ahab shares a moment of contemplation with Starbuck. Ahab speaks about his wife and child, calls himself a fool for spending 40 years on whaling, and claims he can see his own child in Starbuck's eye. Starbuck tries to persuade Ahab to return to Nantucket to meet both their families, but Ahab simply crosses the deck and stands near Fedallah. 
 
 On the first day of the chase, Ahab smells the whale, climbs the mast, and sights Moby Dick. He claims the doubloon for himself, and orders all boats to lower except for Starbuck's. The whale bites Ahab's boat in two, tosses the captain out of it, and scatters the crew. On the second day of the chase, Ahab leaves Starbuck in charge of the ''Pequod''. Moby Dick smashes the three boats that seek him into splinters and tangles their lines. Ahab is rescued, but his ivory leg and Fedallah are lost. Starbuck begs Ahab to desist, but Ahab vows to slay the white whale, even if he would have to dive through the globe itself to get his revenge. 
 
 On the third day of the chase, Ahab sights Moby Dick at noon, and sharks appear, as well. Ahab lowers his boat for a final time, leaving Starbuck again on board. Moby Dick breaches and destroys two boats. Fedallah's corpse, still entangled in the fouled lines, is lashed to the whale's back, so Moby Dick turns out to be the hearse Fedallah prophesied. 
 
 " Possessed by all the fallen angels " , Ahab plants his harpoon in the whale's flank. Moby Dick smites the whaleboat, tossing its men into the sea. Only Ishmael is unable to return to the boat. He is left behind in the sea, and so is the only crewman of the ''Pequod'' to survive the final encounter. The whale now fatally attacks the ''Pequod''. Ahab then realizes that the destroyed ship is the hearse made of American wood in Fedallah's prophecy. 
 
 The whale returns to Ahab, who stabs at him again. As he does so, the line gets tangled, and Ahab bends over to free it. In doing so the line loops around Ahab's neck, and as the stricken whale swims away, the captain is drawn with him out of sight. Queequeg's coffin comes to the surface, the only thing to escape the vortex when ''Pequod'' sank. For a day and a night, Ishmael floats on it, until the ''Rachel'', still looking for its lost seamen, rescues him. 
 
 ==Structure== 
 
 === Point of view === 
 Ishmael is the narrator, shaping his story with use of many different genres including sermons, stage plays, soliloquies, and emblematical readings.  Bezanson (1953), 644   Repeatedly, Ishmael refers to his writing of the book:  " But how can I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I must, else all these chapters might be naught. "  Quoted in Bezanson (1953), 645   Scholar John Bryant calls him the novel's  " central consciousness and narrative voice. "  Bryant (1998), 67–8   Walter Bezanson  first distinguishes Ishmael as narrator from Ishmael as character, whom he calls  " forecastle Ishmael " , the younger Ishmael of some years ago. Narrator Ishmael, then, is  " merely young Ishmael grown older. "   A second distinction avoids confusion of either of both Ishmaels with the author Herman Melville. Bezanson warns readers to  " resist any one-to-one equation of Melville and Ishmael. "  Bezanson (1953), 647  
 
 === Chapter structure === 
 According to critic Walter Bezanson, the chapter structure can be divided into  " chapter sequences " ,  " chapter clusters " , and  " balancing chapters " . The simplest sequences are of narrative progression, then sequences of theme such as the three chapters on whale painting, and sequences of structural similarity, such as the five dramatic chapters beginning with  " The Quarter-Deck "  or the four chapters beginning with  " The Candles " . Chapter clusters are the chapters on the significance of the color white, and those on the meaning of fire. Balancing chapters are chapters of opposites, such as  " Loomings "  versus the  " Epilogue, "  or similars, such as  " The Quarter-Deck "  and  " The Candles " .  Bezanson (1953), 653  
 
 Scholar Lawrence Buell describes the arrangement of the non-narrative chapters}} as structured around three patterns: first, the nine meetings of the ''Pequod'' with ships that have encountered Moby Dick. Each has been more and more severely damaged, foreshadowing the ''Pequod''s own fate. Second, the increasingly impressive encounters with whales. In the early encounters, the whaleboats hardly make contact; later there are false alarms and routine chases; finally, the massive assembling of whales at the edges of the China Sea in  " The Grand Armada " . A typhoon near Japan sets the stage for Ahab's confrontation with Moby Dick.  
 
 The third pattern is the cetological documentation, so lavish that it can be divided into two subpatterns. These chapters start with the ancient history of whaling and a bibliographical classification of whales, getting closer with second-hand stories of the evil of whales in general and of Moby Dick in particular, a chronologically ordered commentary on pictures of whales. The climax to this section is chapter 57,  " Of whales in paint etc. " , which begins with the humble (a beggar in London) and ends with the sublime (the constellation Cetus). The next chapter ( " Brit " ), thus the other half of this pattern, begins with the book's first description of live whales, and next the anatomy of the sperm whale is studied, more or less from front to rear and from outer to inner parts, all the way down to the skeleton. Two concluding chapters set forth the whale's evolution as a species and claim its eternal nature.  Buell (2014), 367  
 
 Some  " ten or more "  of the chapters on whale killings, beginning at two-fifths of the book, are developed enough to be called  " events " . As Bezanson writes,  " in each case a killing provokes either a chapter sequence or a chapter cluster of cetological lore growing out of the circumstance of the particular killing, "  thus these killings are  " structural occasions for ordering the whaling essays and sermons " .  Bezanson (1953), 654  
 
 Buell observes that the  " narrative architecture "  is an  " idiosyncratic variant of the bipolar observer/hero narrative " , that is, the novel is structured around the two main characters, Ahab and Ishmael, who are intertwined and contrasted with each other, with Ishmael the observer and narrator.  Buell (2014), 365   As the story of Ishmael, remarks Robert Milder, it is a  " narrative of education " .  Milder (1988), 434  
 
 Bryant and Springer find that the book is structured around the two consciousnesses of Ahab and Ishmael, with Ahab as a force of linearity and Ishmael a force of digression.  Bryant and Springer (2007), xvi   While both have an angry sense of being orphaned, they try to come to terms with this hole in their beings in different ways: Ahab with violence, Ishmael with meditation. And while the plot in ''Moby-Dick'' may be driven by Ahab's anger, Ishmael's desire to get a hold of the  " ungraspable "  accounts for the novel's lyricism.  Bryant and Springer (2007), x   Buell sees a double quest in the book: Ahab's is to hunt Moby Dick, Ishmael's is  " to understand what to make of both whale and hunt " .  
 
 One of the most distinctive features of the book is the variety of genres. Bezanson mentions sermons, dreams, travel account, autobiography, Elizabethan plays, and epic poetry.  Bezanson (1986), 188   He calls Ishmael's explanatory footnotes to establish the documentary genre  " a Nabokovian touch " .  Bezanson (1986), 195  
 
 === Nine meetings with other ships === 
 A significant structural device is the series of nine meetings (gams) between the ''Pequod'' and other ships. These meetings are important in three ways. First, their placement in the narrative. The initial two meetings and the last two are both close to each other. The central group of five gams are separated by about 12 chapters, more or less. This pattern provides a structural element, remarks Bezanson, as if the encounters were  " bones to the book's flesh " . Second, Ahab's developing responses to the meetings plot the  " rising curve of his passion "  and of his monomania. Third, in contrast to Ahab, Ishmael interprets the significance of each ship individually:  " each ship is a scroll which the narrator unrolls and reads. "  
 
 Bezanson sees no single way to account for the meaning of all of these ships. Instead, they may be interpreted as  " a group of metaphysical parables, a series of biblical analogues, a masque of the situation confronting man, a pageant of the humors within men, a parade of the nations, and so forth, as well as concrete and symbolic ways of thinking about the White Whale " .  Bezanson (1953), 655, italics Bezanson's  
 
 Scholar Nathalia Wright sees the meetings and the significance of the vessels along other lines. She singles out the four vessels which have already encountered Moby Dick. The first, the ''Jeroboam'', is named after the predecessor of the biblical King Ahab. Her  " prophetic "  fate is  " a message of warning to all who follow, articulated by Gabriel and vindicated by the ''Samuel Enderby'', the ''Rachel'', the ''Delight'', and at last the ''Pequod'' " . None of the other ships has been completely destroyed because none of their captains shared Ahab's monomania; the fate of the ''Jeroboam'' reinforces the structural parallel between Ahab and his biblical namesake:  " Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him "  (Books of Kings|I Kings 16:33).  Wright (1949), 66–67  
 
 ==Themes== 
 An early enthusiast for the Melville Revival, British author E. & nbsp;M. Forster, remarked in 1927:  " ''Moby-Dick'' is full of meanings: its meaning is a different problem. "  Forster (1927), 143–144   Yet he saw as  " the essential "  in the book  " its prophetic song " , which flows  " like an undercurrent "  beneath the surface action and morality.  Forster (1927), 142  
 
 Biographer Laurie Robertson-Lorant sees epistemology as the book's theme. Ishmael's taxonomy of whales merely demonstrates  " the limitations of scientific knowledge and the impossibility of achieving certainty " . She also contrasts Ishmael and Ahab's attitudes toward life, with Ishmael's open-minded and meditative,  " polypositional stance "  as antithetical to Ahab's monomania, adhering to dogmatic rigidity.  Robertson-Lorant (1996), 279-80  
 
 Melville biographer Andrew Delbanco cites race as an example of this search for truth beneath surface differences. All races are represented among the crew members of the ''Pequod''. Although Ishmael initially is afraid of Queequeg as a tattooed cannibal, he soon decides,  " Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian. "  Ch.3,  " The Spouter Inn " .   While it may be rare for a mid-19th century American book to feature black characters in a nonslavery context, slavery is frequently mentioned. The theme of race is primarily carried by Pip, the diminutive black cabin boy.  Delbanco (2005), 159   When Pip has almost drowned, Ahab, genuinely touched by Pip's suffering, questions him gently, Pip  " can only parrot the language of an advertisement for the return of a fugitive slave: 'Pip! Reward for Pip!' " .  Delbanco (2005), 161  
 
 Editors Bryant and Springer suggest perception is a central theme, the difficulty of seeing and understanding, which makes deep reality hard to discover and truth hard to pin down. Ahab explains that, like all things, the evil whale wears a disguise:  " All visible objects, man, are but pasteboard masks "  — and Ahab is determined to  " strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside, except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that wall "  (Ch. 36,  " The Quarter-Deck " ). This theme pervades the novel, perhaps never so emphatically as in  " The Doubloon "  (Ch. 99), where each crewmember perceives the coin in a way shaped by his own personality. Later, the American edition has Ahab  " discover no sign "  (Ch. 133) of the whale when he is staring into the deep. In fact, Moby Dick is then swimming up at him. In the British edition, Melville changed the word  " discover "  to  " perceive " , and with good reason, for  " discovery "  means finding what is already there, but  " perceiving " , or better still, perception, is  " a matter of shaping what exists by the way in which we see it " .  Bryant and Springer (2007), xxii   The point is not that Ahab would discover the whale as an object, but that he would perceive it as a symbol of his making.  
 
 Yet Melville does not offer easy solutions. Ishmael and Queequeg's sensual friendship initiates a kind of racial harmony that is shattered when the crew's dancing erupts into racial conflict in  " Midnight, Forecastle "  (Ch. 40).   Fifty chapters later, Pip suffers mental disintegration after he is reminded that as a slave he would be worth less money than a whale. Commodified and brutalized,  " Pip becomes the ship's conscience " .  Bryant and Springer (2007), xvii   His views of property are another example of wrestling with moral choice. In Chapter 89, Ishmael expounds the concept of the fast-fish and the loose-fish, which gives right of ownership to those who take possession of an abandoned fish or ship, and observes that the British Empire took possession of American Indian lands in colonial times in just the way that whalers take possession of an unclaimed whale.    
 
 The novel has also been read as being critical of the contemporary literary and philosophical movement Transcendentalism, attacking the thought of leading Transcendentalist     Ralph Waldo Emerson in particular.     The life and death of Ahab has been read as an attack on Emerson's philosophy of Self-Reliance|self-reliance, for one, in its destructive potential and potential justification for egoism. Richard Chase writes that for Melville, 'Death–spiritual, emotional, physical–is the price of self-reliance when it is pushed to the point of solipsism, where the world has no existence apart from the all-sufficient self.'     In that regard, Chase sees Melville's art as antithetical to that of Emerson's thought, in that Melville '[points] up the dangers of an exaggerated self-regard, rather than, as ... Emerson loved to do, [suggested] the vital possibilities of the self.'   Newton Arvin further suggests that self-reliance was, for Melville, really the '[masquerade in kingly weeds of] a wild egoism, anarchic, irresponsible, and destructive.'    
 
 ==Style== 
 
 " Above all " , say the scholars Bryant and Springer, ''Moby-Dick'' is language:  " nautical, biblical, Homeric, Shakespearean, Miltonic, cetological, alliterative, fanciful, colloquial, archaic and unceasingly allusive " . Melville stretches grammar, quotes well-known or obscure sources, or swings from calm prose to high rhetoric, technical exposition, seaman's slang, mystic speculation, or wild prophetic archaism.  Bryant and Springer (2007), xv   Melville coined words, critic Newton Arvin recognizes, as if the English vocabulary were too limited for the complex things he had to express. Perhaps the most striking example is the use of verbal nouns, mostly plural, such as ''allurings'', ''coincidings'', and ''leewardings''. Equally abundant are unfamiliar adjectives and adverbs, including participial adjectives such as ''officered'', ''omnitooled'', and ''uncatastrophied''; participial adverbs such as ''intermixingly'', ''postponedly'', and ''uninterpenetratingly''; rarities such as the adjectives ''unsmoothable'', ''spermy'', and ''leviathanic'', and adverbs such as ''sultanically'', ''Spanishly'', and ''Venetianly''; and adjectival compounds ranging from odd to magnificent, such as  " the ''message-carrying'' air " ,  " the ''circus-running'' sun " , and  " ''teeth-tiered'' sharks " .  Arvin (1950), 204-205. Arvin's italics.   It is rarer for Melville to create his own verbs from nouns, but he does this with what Arvin calls  " irresistible effect " , such as in  " who didst ''thunder'' him higher than a throne " , and  " my fingers ... began ... to ''serpentine'' and ''spiralize'' " .  Arvin (1950), 206. Arvin's italics.   For Arvin, the essence of the writing style of ''Moby-Dick'' lies in 
 :the manner in which the parts of speech are 'intermixingly' assorted in Melville's style--so that the distinction between verbs and nouns, substantives and modifiers, becomes a half unreal one--this is the prime characteristic of his language. No feature of it could express more tellingly the awareness that lies below and behind ''Moby-Dick''--the awareness that action and condition, movement and stasis, object and idea, are but surface aspects of one underlying reality.  Arvin (1950), 206  
 
 Later critics have expanded Arvin's categories. The superabundant vocabulary can be broken down into strategies used individually and in combination. First, the original modification of words as  " Leviathanism "  Lee (2006), 395   and the exaggerated repetition of modified words, as in the series  " pitiable " ,  " pity " ,  " pitied "  and  " piteous "  (Ch. 81,  " The Pequod Meets the Virgin " ).  Berthoff (1962), 164   Second, the use of existing words in new ways, as when the whale  " heaps "  and  " tasks " .   Third, words lifted from specialized fields, as  " fossiliferous " .   Fourth, the use of unusual adjective-noun combinations, as in  " concentrating brow "  and  " immaculate manliness "  (Ch. 26,  " Knights and Squires " ).  Berthoff (1962), 163   Fifth, using the participial modifier to emphasize and to reinforce the already established expectations of the reader, as the words  " preluding "  and  " foreshadowing "  ( " so still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene ... " ;  " In this foreshadowing interval ... " ).  
 
 Other characteristic stylistic elements are the echoes and overtones, both imitation of distinct styles and habitual use of sources to shape his own work. His three most important sources, in order, are the Bible, Shakespeare, and Milton.  Bercaw (1987), 10  
 
 The novel uses several levels of rhetoric. The simplest is  " a relatively straightforward ''expository'' style " , such as in the cetological chapters, though they are  " rarely sustained, and serve chiefly as transitions "  between more sophisticated levels. A second level is the  " ''poetic'' " , such as in Ahab's quarter-deck monologue, to the point that it can be set as blank verse.  Bezanson (1953), 648, italics Bezanson's   Set over a metrical pattern, the rhythms are  " evenly controlled—too evenly perhaps for prose, "  Bezanson suggests.  Bezanson (1953), 648–49, italics Bezanson's   A third level is the ''idiomatic'', and just as the poetic it hardly is present in pure form. Examples of this are  " the consistently excellent idiom "  of Stubb, such as in the way he encourages the rowing crew in a rhythm of speech that suggests  " the beat of the oars takes the place of the metronomic meter " . The fourth and final level of rhetoric is the ''composite'',  " a magnificent blending "  of the first three and possible other elements: 
 
  The Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation. ''There'' is his home; ''there'' lies his business, which a Noah's flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.  
 ( " Nantucket, "  Ch. 14).  
 
 Bezanson calls this chapter a comical  " prose poem "  that blends  " high and low with a relaxed assurance " . Similar passages include the  " marvelous hymn to spiritual democracy "  in the middle of  " Knights and Squires " .  Bezanson (1953), 649  
 
 The elaborate use of the Homeric simile may not have been learned from Homer himself, yet Matthiessen finds the writing  " more consistently alive "  on the Homeric than on the Shakespearean level, especially during the final chase the  " controlled accumulation "  of such similes emphasizes Ahab's hubris through a succession of land-images, for instance:  " The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannon-ball, missent, becomes a ploughshare and turns up the level field "  ( " The Chase – Second Day, "  Ch. 134).  Matthiessen (1941), 461   A paragraph-long simile describes how the 30 men of the crew became a single unit: 
 
  For as the one ship that held them all; though it was put together of all contrasting things—oak, and maple, and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp—yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced and directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities of the crew, this man's valor, that man's fear; guilt and guiltiness, all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.  
 ( " The Chase – Second Day, "  Ch. 134).  
 
 The final phrase fuses the two halves of the comparison; the men become identical with the ship, which follows Ahab's direction. The concentration only gives way to more imagery, with the  " mastheads, like the tops of tall palms, were outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs " . All these images contribute their  " startling energy "  to the advance of the narrative. When the boats are lowered, the imagery serves to dwarf everything but Ahab's will in the presence of Moby Dick.   These similes, with their astonishing  " imaginative abundance, "  not only create dramatic movement, Matthiessen observes:  " They are no less notable for breadth; and the more sustained among them, for an heroic dignity. "  Matthiessen (1941), 462–63  
 
 ===Assimilation of Shakespeare=== 
 F. O. Matthiessen in 1941 declared that Melville's  " possession by Shakespeare went far beyond all other influences "  in that it made Melville discover his own full strength  " through the challenge of the most abundant imagination in history " .  Matthiessen (1941), 424   This insight was then reinforced by the study of Melville's annotatations in his reading copy of Shakespeare, which show that he immersed himself in Shakespeare when he was preparing for ''Moby-Dick'' , especially ''King Lear'' and ''Macbeth''.  Grey (2006), [ & bsq=Lear 253]    Reading Shakespeare, Matthiessen observes, was  " a catalytic agent " , one that transformed his writing  " from limited reporting to the expression of profound natural forces " .  Matthiessen (1941), 428    
 
 The creation of Ahab, Melville biographer Leon Howard discovered, followed an observation by Coleridge in his lecture on ''Hamlet'':  " one of Shakespeare's modes of creating characters is to conceive any one intellectual or moral faculty in ''morbid'' excess, and then to place himself. ... thus ''mutilated'' or ''diseased'', under given circumstances " .  Quoted in Howard (1940), 232. Howard's italics.   Coleridge's vocabulary is echoed in some phrases that describe Ahab. Ahab seemed to have  " what seems a half-wilful ''over-ruling morbidness'' at the bottom of his nature " , and  " all men tragically great " , Melville added,  " are made so through a certain ''morbidness'';  " all mortal greatness is but ''disease'' " . In addition to this, in Howard's view, the self-references of Ishmael as a  " tragic dramatist " , and his defense of his choice of a hero who lacked  " all outward majestical trappings "  is evidence that Melville  " consciously thought of his protagonist as a tragic hero of the sort found in ''Hamlet'' and ''King Lear'' " .  Howard (1940), 232. Howard's italics.  
 
 Matthiessen demonstrates the extent to which Melville was in full possession of his powers in the description of Ahab, which ends in language  " that suggests Shakespeare's but is not an imitation of it: 'Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked from the skies and dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied air!' The imaginative richness of the final phrase seems particularly Shakespearean,  " but its two key words appear only once each in the plays & nbsp;... and to neither of these usages is Melville indebted for his fresh combination. "  Matthiessen (1941), 428–429   Melville's assimilation of Shakespeare, Matthiessen concludes, gave ''Moby-Dick''  " a kind of diction that depended upon no source " ,  Matthiessen (1941), 429   and that could, as D.H. Lawrence put it, convey something  " almost superhuman or inhuman, bigger than life " .  Quoted in Matthiessen (1941), 429   The prose is not based on anybody else's verse but on  " a sense of speech rhythm " .  Matthiessen (1941), 430  
 
 Matthiessen finds debts to Shakespeare, whether hard or easy to recognize, on almost every page. He points out that the phrase  " mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing "  at the end of  " Cetology "  (Ch.32) echo the famous phrase in ''Macbeth'':  " Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing. "   Matthiessen shows that Ahab's first extended speech to the crew, in the  " Quarter-Deck "  (Ch.36), is  " virtually blank verse, and can be printed as such " :  
 
  But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat,  
 That thing unsays itself. There are men  
 From whom warm words are small indignity.  
 I mean not to incense thee. Let it go.  
 Look! see yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn--  
 Living, breathing pictures painted by the sun.  
 The pagan leopards—the unrecking and  
 Unworshipping things, that live; and seek and give  
 No reason for the torrid life they feel!  Matthiessen (1941), 426   
 
 In addition to this sense of rhythm, Matthiessen shows that Melville  " now mastered Shakespeare's mature secret of how to make language itself dramatic " .   He had learned three essential things, Matthiessen sums up: 
 * To rely on verbs of action,  " which lend their dynamic pressure to both movement and meaning. "   The effective tension caused by the contrast of  " thou launchest navies of full-freighted worlds "  and  " there's that in here that still remains indifferent "  in  " The Candles "  (Ch. 119) makes the last clause lead to a  " compulsion to strike the breast " , which suggests  " how thoroughly the drama has come to inhere in the words; "  Matthiessen (1941), 430–31  
 * The Shakespearean energy of verbal compounds was not lost on him ( " full-freighted " ); 
 * And, finally, Melville learned how to handle  " the quickened sense of life that comes from making one part of speech act as another & nbsp;– for example, 'earthquake' as an adjective, or the coining of 'placeless', an adjective from a noun. "  Matthiessen (1941), 431  
 
 ==Background== 
 
 ===Autobiographical elements=== 
 ''Moby-Dick'' draws on Melville's experience on the whaler ''Acushnet'', but  is not autobiographical. On December 30, 1840, Melville signed on as a green hand for the maiden voyage of the ''Acushnet'', planned to last for 52 months. Its owner, Melvin O. Bradford, like Bildad, was a Quakers|Quaker: on several instances when he signed documents, he erased the word  " swear "  and replaced it with  " affirm " . But the shareholders of the ''Acushnet'' were relatively wealthy, whereas the owners of the ''Pequod'' included poor widows and orphaned children.  Heflin (2004), 16    
 
 The model for the Whaleman's Chapel of chapter 7 is the Seamen's Bethel on Johnny Cake Hill. Melville attended a service there shortly before he shipped out on the ''Acushnet'', and he heard a sermon by Reverend Enoch Mudge, who is at least in part the inspiration for Father Mapple. Even the topic of Jonah and the Whale may be authentic, for Mudge contributed sermons on Jonah to ''Sailor's Magazine''   Heflin (2004), 41  
 
 The crew was not as heterogenous or exotic as the crew of the ''Pequod''. Five were foreigners, four of them Portuguese, and the others were American either at birth or naturalized. Three black men were in the crew, two seamen and the cook. Fleece, the black cook of the ''Pequod'', was probably modeled on this Philadelphia-born William Maiden.  Heflin (2004), 26-7   A first mate, actually called Edward C. Starbuck was discharged at Tahiti under mysterious circumstances.  Heflin (2004), 19   The second mate, John Hall, is identified as Stubb in an annotation in the book's copy of crew member Henry Hubbard, who also identified the model for Pip: John Backus, a little black man added to the crew during the voyage.  Heflin (2004), 252 note 26   Hubbard witnessed Pip's fall into the water.   Tanselle (1988), 1012  
 
 Ahab seems to have had no model, though his death may have been based on an actual event. Melville was aboard ''The Star'' in May 1843 with two sailors from the ''Nantucket'' who could have told him that they had seen their second mate  " taken out of a whaleboat by a foul line and drowned " .  Heflin (2004), 189  
 
 ===Whaling sources=== 
 File:Houghton AC85.M4977.Zz839b - History of the Sperm Whale.jpg|thumb|Melville's copy of ''Natural History of the Sperm Whale'', 1839 
 In addition to his own experience on the whaling ship ''Acushnet'', two actual events served as the genesis for Melville's tale. One was the sinking of the Nantucket ship ''Essex (1799 whaleship)|Essex'' in 1820, after a sperm whale rammed her 2,000 miles (3,200 & nbsp;km) from the western coast of South America. First mate Owen Chase, one of eight survivors, recorded the events in his 1821 ''Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-Ship Essex''. 
 
 The other event was the alleged killing in the late 1830s of the albino sperm whale Mocha Dick, in the waters off the Chilean island of Mocha (island)|Mocha. Mocha Dick was rumored to have 20 or so harpoons in his back from other whalers, and appeared to attack ships with premeditated ferocity. One of his battles with a whaler served as subject for an article by explorer Jeremiah N. Reynolds in the May 1839 issue of ''The Knickerbocker or New-York Monthly Magazine''.  Reynolds, J.N.,  " Mocha Dick: or the White Whale of the Pacific: A Leaf from a Manuscript Journal " , ''The Knickerbocker, or New-York Monthly Magazine''. 13.5, May 1839, pp. & nbsp;377–392.   Melville was familiar with the article, which described:  Significantly, Reynolds writes a First-person narrative|first-person narration that serves as a Frame story|frame for the story of a whaling captain he meets. The captain resembles Ahab and suggests a similar symbolism and single-minded motivation in hunting this whale, in that when his crew first encounters Mocha Dick and cowers from him, the captain rallies them:  
 
 Mocha Dick had over 100 encounters with whalers in the decades between 1810 and the 1830s. He was described as being gigantic and covered in barnacles. Although he was the most famous, Mocha Dick was not the only white whale in the sea, nor the only whale to attack hunters.  , 66–79  
 
 While an accidental collision with a sperm whale at night accounted for sinking of the ''Union'' in 1807,  [ & lpg=PA115 & ots=wLKjJyW1K_ & dq=the%20ship%20union%2C%20of%20Nantucket%20September%2C%201807%20Edmund%20Gardner & pg=PA115#v=onepage & q=the%20ship%20union,%20of%20Nantucket%20September,%201807%20Edmund%20Gardner & f=false Report of the Commissioner By United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries, p115]   it was not until August 1851 that the whaler ''Ann Alexander (ship)|Ann Alexander'', while hunting in the Pacific off the Galápagos Islands, became the second vessel since the ''Essex'' to be attacked, holed, and sunk by a whale. Melville remarked,  " Ye Gods! What a commentator is this ''Ann Alexander'' whale. What he has to say is short  &  pithy  &  very much to the point. I wonder if my evil art has raised this monster. "  [ Melville's Reflections, a page from The Life and Works of Herman Melville]  
 
 While Melville had already drawn on his different sailing experiences in his previous novels, such as ''Mardi'', he had never focused specifically on whaling. The 18 months he spent as an ordinary seaman aboard the whaler ''Acushnet'' in 1841–42, and one incident in particular, now served as inspiration. During a mid-ocean  " gam "  (rendezvous at sea between ships), he met Chase's son William, who lent him his father's book. Melville later wrote:  
 
 The book was out of print, and rare. Melville let his interest in the book be known to his father-in-law, Lemuel Shaw, whose friend in Nantucket procured an imperfect but clean copy which Shaw gave to Melville in April 1851. Melville read this copy avidly, made copious notes in it, and had it bound, keeping it in his library for the rest of his life.  
 
 File:Herman Melville.jpg|thumb|Herman Melville 
 
 ''Moby-Dick'' contains large sections—most of them narrated by Ishmael—that seemingly have nothing to do with the plot, but describe aspects of the whaling business. Although a successful earlier novel about Nantucket whalers had been written, ''Miriam Coffin or The Whale-Fisherman'' (1835) by Joseph C. Hart,  Mary K. Bercaw,  " A Fine, Boisterous Something " : Nantucket in Moby-Dick, ''Historic Nantucket'', Vol. 39, No. 3 (Fall 1991); Philip Armstrong, ''What animals mean in the fiction of modernity'', Routledge, 2008, p.132   which is credited with influencing elements of Melville's work, most accounts of whaling tended to be sensational tales of bloody mutiny, and Melville believed that no book up to that time had portrayed the whaling industry in as fascinating or immediate a way as he had experienced it. 
 
 Melville found the bulk of his data on whales and whaling in five books, the most important of which was by the English ship's surgeon Thomas Beale, ''Natural History of the Sperm Whale'' (1839), a book of reputed authority which Melville bought on July 10, 1850.  Vincent (1949), 128    " In scale and complexity, "  scholar Steven Olsen-Smith writes,  " the significance of [this source] to the composition of ''Moby-Dick'' surpasses that of any other source book from which Melville is known to have drawn. "  Steven Olsen-Smith (2010), [  " Introduction to Melville's Marginalia in Thomas Beale's ''The Natural History of the Sperm Whale''. "  ''Melville's Marginalia Online''. Retrieved on 30 November 2016.]    According to scholar Howard P. Vincent, the general influence of this source is to supply the arrangement of whaling data in chapter groupings.  Vincent (1949), 129   Melville followed Beale's grouping closely, yet adapted it to what art demanded, and he changed the original's prosaic phrases into graphic figures of speech.  Vincent (1949), 130   The second most important whaling book is Frederick Debell Bennett, ''A Whaling Voyage Round the Globe, from the Year 1833 to 1836'' (1840), from which Melville also took the chapter organization, but in a lesser degree than he learned from Beale.  
 
 The third book was the one Melville reviewed for the ''Literary World'' in 1847, J. Ross Browne's ''Etchings of a Whaling Cruise'' (1846), which may have given Melville the first thought for a whaling book, and in any case contains passages embarrassingly similar to passages in ''Moby-Dick''.  Vincent (1949), 131   The fourth book, Reverend Henry T. Cheever's ''The Whale and His Captors'' (1850), was used for two episodes in ''Moby-Dick'' but probably appeared too late in the writing of the novel to be of much more use.   Melville did plunder a fifth book, William Scoresby, Jr., ''An Account of the Arctic Regions with a History and Description of the Northern Whale Fishery'' (1820), though—unlike the other four books—its subject is the Greenland whale rather than the sperm whale. Although the book became the standard whaling reference soon after publication, Melville satirized and parodied it on several occasions—for instance in the description of narwhales in the chapter  " Cetology " , where he called Scoresby  " Charley Coffin "  and gave his account  " a humorous twist of fact " :  " Scoresby will help out Melville several times, and on each occasion Melville will satirize him under a pseudonym. "  Vincent suggests several reasons for Melville's attitude towards Scoresby, including his dryness and abundance of irrelevant data, but the major reason seems to have been that the Greenland whale was the sperm whale's closest competitor for the public's attention, so Melville felt obliged to dismiss anything dealing with it.  Vincent (1949), 132–34. Quotation on 134.  
 
 ===Composition=== 
 Scholars have concluded that Melville composed ''Moby-Dick'' in two or even three stages.   Tanselle (1988), 583, 656-58, 832, 849    Reasoning from biographical evidence, analysis of the functions of characters, and a series of unexplained but perhaps meaningful inconsistencies in the final version, they hypothesize that reading Shakespeare and his new friendship with Hawthorne, in the words of Lawrence Buell, inspired Melville to rewrite a  " relatively straightforward "  whaling adventure  into  " an epic of cosmic encyclopedic proportions " .  Buell (2014), 364    
 
 The earliest surviving mention of what became ''Moby-Dick'' is a letter Melville wrote to Richard Henry Dana, Jr. on May 1, 1850:  Melville (1993), 160  
 
  
 
 Bezanson objects that the letter contains too many ambiguities to assume  " that Dana's 'suggestion' would obviously be that Melville do for whaling what he had done for life on a man-of-war in ''White-Jacket'' " .  Walter E. Bezanson,  " ''Moby-Dick'': Document, Drama, Dream, "  in John Bryant (ed.), ''A Companion to Melville Studies'', Greenwoord Press, 1986, 176–180.   Dana had experienced how incomparable Melville was in dramatic storytelling when he met him in Boston, so perhaps  " his 'suggestion' was that Melville do a book that captured that gift " .   And the long sentence in the middle of the above quotation simply acknowledges that Melville is struggling with the problem, not of choosing between fact and fancy but of how to interrelate them. The most positive statements are that it will be a strange sort of a book and that Melville means to give the truth of the thing, but what thing exactly is not clear.  
 
 Melville may have found the plot before writing or developed it after the writing process was underway. Considering his elaborate use of sources,  " it is safe to say "  that they helped him shape the narrative, its plot included.  Bryant and Springer (2007), ix   Scholars John Bryant and Haskell Springer cite the development of the character Ishmael as another factor which prolonged Melville's process of composition and which can be deduced from the structure of the final version of the book. Ishmael, in the early chapters, is simply the narrator, just as the narrators in Melville's earlier sea adventures had been, but in later chapters becomes a mystical stage manager who is central to the tragedy.  Bryant and Springer (2007), xi  
 
 Less than two months after mentioning the project to Dana, Melville reported in a letter of June 27 to Richard Bentley, his English publisher: 
 
  
 
 Nathaniel Hawthorne and his family had moved to a small red farmhouse near Lenox, Massachusetts, at the end of March 1850.  Miller (1991), 274   He became friends with Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. and Melville beginning on August 5, 1850, when the authors met at a picnic hosted by a mutual friend.  Cheever, Susan. (2006). ''American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work''. Large Print ed. Detroit: Thorndike. 174. .   Melville wrote an unsigned review of Hawthorne's short story collection ''Mosses from an Old Manse'' titled  " Hawthorne and His Mosses " , which appeared in ''The Literary World (New York City)|The Literary World'' on August 17 and 24.  Miller (1991), 312   Bezanson finds the essay  " so deeply related to Melville's imaginative and intellectual world while writing ''Moby-Dick'' "  that it could be regarded as a virtual preface and should be  " everybody's prime piece of contextual reading " .   In the essay, Melville compares Hawthorne to Shakespeare and Dante, and his  " self-projection "  is evident in the repeats of the word  " genius " , the more than two dozen references to Shakespeare, and in the insistence that Shakespeare's  " unapproachability "  is nonsense for an American.  
 
 File:Arrowhead farmhouse Herman Melville.jpg|thumb|Arrowhead (Herman Melville House)|Arrowhead, the house in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, in which Melville worked on ''Moby-Dick'' 
 
 The most intense work on the book was done during the winter of 1850–1851, when Melville had changed the noise of New York City for a farm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The move may well have delayed finishing the book.  Springer and Bryant (2007), xi   During these months, he wrote several excited letters to Hawthorne, including one of June 1851 in which he summarizes his career:  " What I feel most moved to write, that is banned, — it will not pay. Yet, altogether, write the ''other'' way I cannot. So the product is a final hash, and all my books are botches. "  Melville (1993), 191  
 
 This is the stubborn Melville who stood by ''Mardi'' and talked about his other, more commercial books with contempt. The letter also reveals how Melville experienced his development from his 25th year:  " Three weeks have scarcely passed, at any time between then and now, that I have not unfolded within myself. But I feel that I am now come to the inmost leaf of the bulb, and that shortly the flower must fall to the mould. "  Melville (1993), 193  
 
 Buell finds the evidence that Melville changed his ambitions during writing  " on the whole convincing " , since the impact of Shakespeare and Hawthorne was  " surely monumental " ,   but others challenge the theories of the composition in three ways. The first raises objections on the use of evidence and the evidence itself. Bryant finds  " little concrete evidence, and nothing at all conclusive, to show that Melville radically altered the structure or conception of the book " .  Bryant (1998), 67   and scholar Robert Milder sees  " insufficient evidence and doubtful methodology "  at work.  Milder (1977), 215    A second type of objection is based on assumptions about Melville's intellectual development. Bryant and Springer object to the conclusion that Hawthorne inspired Melville to write Ahab's tragic obsession into the book; Melville already had experienced other encounters which could just as well have triggered his imagination, such as the Bible's Jonah and Job, Milton's Satan, Shakespeare's King Lear, Byron's heroes.    Bezanson is also not convinced that before he met Hawthorne,  " Melville was ''not'' ready for the kind of book ''Moby-Dick'' became " ,   because in his letters from the time Melville denounces his last two  " straight narratives, ''Redburn'' and ''White-Jacket'', as two books written just for the money, and he firmly stood by ''Mardi'' as the kind of book he believed in. His language is already  " richly steeped in 17th-century mannerisms " , characteristics of ''Moby-Dick''. A third type calls upon the literary nature of passages used as evidence. According to Milder, the cetological chapters cannot be leftovers from an earlier stage of composition and any theory that they are  " will eventually founder on the stubborn meaningfulness of these chapters " , because no scholar adhering to the theory has yet explained how these chapters  " can bear intimate thematic relation to a symbolic story not yet conceived " .  Milder (1977), 208  
 
 Buell finds that theories based on a combination of selected passages from letters and what are perceived as  " loose ends "  in the book not only  " tend to dissolve into guesswork " , but he also suggests that these so-called loose ends may be intended by the author: repeatedly the book mentions  " the necessary unfinishedness of immense endeavors " .  
 
 ==Publication history== 
 Melville first proposed the British publication in a June 27, 1850, letter to Richard Bentley (publisher)|Richard Bentley, London publisher of his earlier works. Textual scholar G. Thomas Tanselle explains that for these earlier books, American proof sheets had been sent to the British publisher and that publication in the United States had been held off until the work had been set in type and published in England. This procedure was intended to provide the best (though still uncertain) claim for the UK copyright of an American work.  [ & printsec=frontcover & hl=nl#v=onepage & q & f=false Tanselle (1988), 660]   In the case of ''Moby-Dick'', Melville had taken almost a year longer than promised, and could not rely on Harpers to prepare the proofs as they had done for the earlier books. Indeed, Harpers had denied him an advance, and since he was already in debt to them for almost $700, he was forced to borrow money and to arrange for the typesetting and plating himself.  Cited by Tanselle (1988), 660–661   John Bryant suggests that he did so  " to reduce the number of hands playing with his text " .  Bryant (2006), 560  
 
 The final stages of composition overlapped with the early stages of publication. In June 1851, Melville wrote to Hawthorne that he was in New York to  " work and slave on my 'Whale' while it is driving through the press " .  Cited in Tanselle (1988), 663.   By the end of the month,  " wearied with the long delay of printers " , Melville came back to finish work on the book in Pittsfield. Three weeks later, the typesetting was almost done, as he announced to Bentley on July 20:  " I am now passing thro' the press, the closing sheets of my new work " .   While Melville was simultaneously writing and proofreading what had been set, the corrected proof would be plated, that is, the type fixed in final form. Since earlier chapters were already plated when he was revising the later ones, Melville must have  " felt restricted in the kinds of revisions that were feasible " .  Tanselle (1988), 663  
 
 On July 3, 1851, Bentley offered Melville £150 and  " half profits " , that is, half the profits that remained after the expenses of production and advertising. On July 20, Melville accepted, after which Bentley drew up a contract on August 13.  Tanselle (1988), 665.   Melville signed and returned the contract in early September, and then went to New York with the proof sheets, made from the finished plates, which he sent to London by his brother Allan on September 10. For over a month, these proofs had been in Melville's possession, and because the book would be set anew in London he could devote all his time to correcting and revising them. He still had no American publisher, so the usual hurry about getting the British publication to precede the American was not present.  Tanselle (1988), 667   Only on September 12 was the Harper publishing contract signed.  Tanselle (1988), 661   Bentley received the proof sheets with Melville's corrections and revisions marked on them on September 24. He published the book less than four weeks later. 
 
 In the October 1851 issue of ''Harper's Magazine|Harper's New Monthly Magazine''  " The Town Ho's Story "  was published, with a footnote reading:  " From 'The Whale'. The title of a new work by Mr. Melville, in the press of Harper and Brothers, and now publishing in London by Mr. Bentley. "  Quoted in Tanselle (1988), 671  
 
 On October 18, the British edition, ''The Whale'', was published in a printing of only 500 copies,     fewer than Melville's previous books. Their slow sales had convinced Bentley that a smaller number was more realistic. The London ''Morning Herald'' on October 20 printed the earliest known review.  Tanselle (1988), 683–84   On November 14, the American edition, ''Moby-Dick'', was published and the same day reviewed in both the Albany ''Argus'' and the ''Morning Courier and New-York Enquirer''. On November 19, Washington received the copy to be deposited for copyright purposes. The first American printing of 2,915 copies was almost the same as the first of ''Mardi'', but the first printing of Melville's other three Harper books had been a thousand copies more.  Tanselle (1988), 686–87  
 
 ===Melville's revisions and British editorial revisions=== 
 The British edition, set by Bentley's printers from the American page proofs with Melville's revisions and corrections, differs from the American edition in over 700 wordings and thousands of punctuation and spelling changes.  
 
 Excluding the preliminaries and the one extract, the three volumes of the British edition came to 927 pages  Tanselle (1988), 685   and the single American volume to 635 pages.  Tanselle (1988), 687   Accordingly, the dedication to Hawthorne in the American edition —  " this book is inscribed to " — became  " these volumes are inscribed to "  in the British.  Cited in Tanselle (1988), 673   The table of contents in the British edition generally follows the actual chapter titles in the American edition, but 19 titles in the American table of contents differ from the titles above the chapters themselves. This list was probably drawn up by Melville himself: the titles of chapters describing encounters of the ''Pequod'' with other ships had—apparently to stress the parallelisms between these chapters—been standardized to  " The Pequod meets the ..., "  with the exception of the already published 'The Town-Ho's Story'.  Tanselle (1988), 675–76  
 
 For unknown reasons, the  " Etymology "  and  " Extracts "  were moved to the end of the third volume.  Tanselle (1988), 678   An epigraph from ''Paradise Lost'', taken from the second of the two quotations from that work in the American edition, appears on the title page of each of the three British volumes. Melville's involvement with this rearrangement is not clear: if it was Bentley's gesture toward accommodating Melville, as Tanselle suggests,   its selection put an emphasis on the quotation Melville might not have agreed with. 
 
 The largest of Melville's revisions is the addition to the British edition of a 139-word footnote in Chapter 87 explaining the word  " gally " . The edition also contains six short phrases and some 60 single words lacking in the American edition.  Tanselle (1988), 772   In addition, about 35 changes produce genuine improvements, as opposed to mere corrections:  " Melville may not have made every one of the changes in this category, but it seems certain that he was responsible for the great majority of them. "  Tanselle (1988), 789  
 
 ===British censorship and missing  " Epilogue " === 
 The British publisher hired one or more revisers who were, in the evaluation of scholar Steven Olsen-Smith, responsible for  " unauthorized changes ranging from typographical errors and omissions to acts of outright censorship " .  Olsen-Smith (2008), 97   According to biographer Robertson-Lorant, the result was that the British edition was  " badly mutilated " .  Robertson-Lorant (1996), 277   The expurgations fall into four categories, ranked according to the apparent priorities of the censor: 
 # Sacrilegious passages, more than 1,200 words: Attributing human failures to God was grounds for excision or revision, as was comparing human shortcomings to divine ones. For example, in chapter 28,  " Ahab " , Ahab stands with  " a crucifixion in his face "  was revised to  " an apparently eternal anguish " ;  Cited in Tanselle (1988), 681 (citation), 784  
 # Sexual matters, including the sex life of whales and even Ishmael's worried anticipation of the nature of Queequeg's underwear, as well as allusions to fornication or harlots, and  " our hearts' honeymoon "  (in relation to Ishmael and Queequeg)  Tanselle (1988), 682, 784–85   Chapter 95, however,  " The Cassock " , referring to the whale's genital organ, was untouched, perhaps because of Melville's indirect language. 
 # Remarks  " belittling royalty or implying a criticism of the British " : This meant the exclusion of the complete chapter 25, a  " Postscript "  on the use of sperm oil at coronations;  Tanselle (1988), 682, 785  
 # Perceived grammatical or stylistic anomalies were treated with  " a highly conservative interpretation of rules of 'correctness' " .  Tanselle (1988), 682, 785–87  
 These expurgations also meant that any corrections or revisions Melville had marked upon these passages are now lost. 
 
 The final difference in the material not already plated is that the  " Epilogue " , thus Ishmael's miraculous survival, is omitted from the British edition. Obviously, the epilogue was not an afterthought supplied too late for the edition, for it is referred to in  " The Castaway " :  " in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself. "  Cited in Tanselle (1988), 679   Why the  " Epilogue "  is missing is unknown. Since nothing objectionable was in it, most likely it was somehow lost by Bentley's printer when the  " Etymology "  and  " Extracts "  were moved.  Tanselle (1988), 678–79  
 
 ===Last-minute change of title=== 
 After the sheets had been sent, Melville changed the title. Probably late in September, Allan sent Bentley two pages of proof with a letter of which only a draft survives which informed him that Melville  " has determined upon a new title  &  dedication—Enclosed you have proof of both—It is thought here that the new title will be a better ''selling'' title " . After expressing his hope that Bentley would receive this change in time, Allan said that  " Moby-Dick is a legitimate title for the book, being the name given to a particular whale who if I may so express myself is the hero of the volume " .  Cited in Tanselle (1988), 671   Biographer Hershel Parker suggests that the reason for the change was that Harper's had two years earlier published a book with a similar title, ''The Whale and His Captors''.  Parker (1996), 863  
 
 Changing the title was not a problem for the American edition, since the running heads throughout the book only showed the titles of the chapters, and the title page, which would include the publisher's name, could not be printed until a publisher was found. In October ''Harper's New Monthly Magazine'' printed chapter 54,  " The Town-Ho's Story " , with a footnote saying:  " From ''The Whale.'' The title of a new work by Mr. Melville " .   The one surviving leaf of proof,  " a 'trial' page bearing the title 'The Whale' and the Harper imprint, "  Cited in Tanselle (1988), 672   shows that at this point, after the publisher had been found, the original title still stood. When Allan's letter arrived, no sooner than early October, Bentley had already announced ''The Whale'' in both the ''Athenaem'' and the ''Spectator'' of October 4 and 11.  Tanselle (1988), 673      Probably to accommodate Melville, Bentley inserted a Half title|half-title page in the first volume only, which reads  " The Whale; or, Moby Dick " .  
 
 ===Sales and earnings=== 
 The British printing of 500 copies sold fewer than 300 within the first four months. In 1852, some remaining sheets were bound in a cheaper casing, and in 1853, enough sheets were still left to issue a cheap edition in one volume. Bentley recovered only half on the £150 he advanced Melville, whose share from actual sales would have been just £38, and he did not print a new edition.  Tanselle (1988), 688   Harper's first printing was 2,915 copies, including the standard 125 review copies. The selling price was $1.50, about a fifth of the price of the British three-volume edition.  
 
 About 1,500 copies were sold within 11 days, and then sales slowed down to less than 300 the next year. After three years, the first edition was still available, almost 300 copies of which were lost when a fire broke out at the firm in December 1853. In 1855, a second printing of 250 copies was issued, in 1863, a third of 253 copies, and finally in 1871, a fourth printing of 277 copies, which sold so slowly that no new printing was ordered.   ''Moby-Dick'' was out of print during the last four years of Melville's life, having sold 2,300 in its first year and a half and on average 27 copies a year for the next 34 years, totaling 3,215 copies. 
 
 Melville's earnings from the book add up to $1,260: the £150 advance from Bentley was equivalent to $703, and the American printings earned him $556, which was $100 less than he earned from any of his five previous books.  Tanselle (1988), 689   Melville's widow received another $81 when the United States Book Company issued the book and sold almost 1,800 copies between 1892 and 1898.  
 
 ==Reception== 
 The reception of ''The Whale'' in Britain and of ''Moby-Dick'' in the United States differed in two ways, according to Parker. First, British literary criticism was more sophisticated and developed than in the still-young republic, with British reviewing done by  " cadres of brilliant literary people "  Parker (2002), 17   who were  " experienced critics and trenchant prose stylists " ,  Parker (1988), 700   while the United States had only  " a handful of reviewers "  capable enough to be called critics, and American editors and reviewers habitually echoed British opinion.   American reviewing was mostly delegated to  " newspaper staffers "  or else by  " amateur contributors more noted for religious piety than critical acumen. "   Second, the differences between the two editions caused  " two distinct critical receptions. "  Parker (1988), 701  
 === British === 
 Twenty-one reviews appeared in London, and later one in Dublin.   The British reviewers, according to Parker, mostly regarded ''The Whale'' as  " a phenomenal literary work, a philosophical, metaphysical, and poetic romance " .  Parker (1988), 702   The ''Morning Advertiser'' for October 24 was in awe of Melville's learning, of his  " dramatic ability for producing a prose poem " , and of the whale adventures which were  " powerful in their cumulated horrors. "  Quoted in Parker (1988), 702   To its surprise, ''John Bull'' found  " philosophy in whales "  and  " poetry in blubber " , and concluded that few books that claimed to be either philosophical or literary works  " contain as much true philosophy and as much genuine poetry as the tale of the ''Pequod''s whaling expedition " , making it a work  " far beyond the level of an ordinary work of fiction " .  Parker (1988), 702–03   The ''Morning Post'' found it  " one of the cleverest, wittiest, and most amusing of modern books " , and predicted that it was a book  " which will do great things for the literary reputation of its author " .  
 
 Melville himself never saw these reviews, and Parker calls it a  " bitter irony "  that the reception overseas was  " all he could possibly have hoped for, short of a few conspicuous proclamations that the distance between him and Shakespeare was by no means immeasurable. "  Parker (1988), 703  
 
 One of the earliest reviews, by the extremely conservative critic Henry Chorley   in the highly regarded London ''Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum'', described it as  
 
 According to the London ''Literary Gazette and Journal of Science and Art'' for December 6, 1851,  " Mr. Melville cannot do without savages, so he makes half of his ''dramatis personae'' wild Indians, Malays, and other untamed humanities " , who appeared in  " an odd book, professing to be a novel; wantonly eccentric, outrageously bombastic; in places charmingly and vividly descriptive " .  Robertson-Lorant (1996), 646 note 7   Most critics regretted the extravagant digressions because they distracted from an otherwise interesting and even exciting narrative, but even critics who did not like the book as a whole praised Melville's originality of imagination and expression.  Branch (1974), 27  
 
 Because the English edition omitted the epilogue describing Ishmael's escape, British reviewers read a book with a first-person narrator who apparently did not survive.   The reviewer of the ''Literary Gazette'' asked how Ishmael,  " who appears to have been drowned with the rest, communicated his notes to Mr. Bentley " .   The reviewer in the ''Spectator'' objected that  " nothing should be introduced into a novel which it is physically impossible for the writer to have known: thus, he must not describe the conversation of miners in a pit if they ''all'' perish. "  Cited in Parker (1988), 708   The ''Dublin University Magazine'' asked  " how does it happen that the author is alive to tell the story? "     A few other reviewers, who did not comment upon the apparent impossibility of Ishmael telling the story, pointed out violations of narrative conventions in other passages. 
 
 Other reviewers accepted the flaws they perceived. ''John Bull'' praised the author for making literature out of unlikely and even unattractive matter, and the ''Morning Post'' found that delight far outstripped the improbable character of events.  Parker (1988), 709   Though some reviewers viewed the characters, especially Ahab, as exaggerated, others felt that it took an extraordinary character to undertake the battle with the white whale. Melville's style was often praised, although some found it excessive or too American.  Branch (1974), 28  
 
 === American === 
 Some sixty reviews appeared in America, the criterion for counting as a review being more than two lines of comment.  Parker (1988), 712   Only a couple of reviewers expressed themselves early enough not to be influenced by news of the British reception.   Though ''Moby-Dick'' did contain the ''Epilogue'' and so accounted for Ishmael's survival, the British reviews influenced the American reception. The earliest American review, in the Boston ''Post'' for November 20, quoted the London ''Athenaeum''s scornful review, not realizing that some of the criticism of ''The Whale'' did not pertain to ''Moby-Dick''. This last point, and the authority and influence of British criticism in American reviewing, is clear from the review's opening:  " We have read nearly one half of this book, and are satisfied that the London Athenaeum is right in calling it 'an ill-compounded mixture of romance and matter-of-fact' " .  Quoted in Parker (2002), 18   Though the ''Post'' quoted the greater portion of the review, it omitted the condensed extract of Melville's prose the ''Athenaeum'' had included to give readers an example of it. The ''Post'' deemed the price of one dollar and fifty cents far too much:  " 'The Whale' is not worth the money asked for it, either as a literary work or as a mass of printed paper " .  Quoted in Parker (2002), 20  
 
 The New York ''North American Miscellany'' for December summarized the verdict in the ''Athenaeum''. The reviewer of the December New York ''Eclectic Magazine'' had actually read ''Moby-Dick'' in full, and was puzzled why the ''Athenaeum'' was so scornful of the ending. The attack on ''The Whale'' by the ''Spectator'' was reprinted in the December New York ''International Magazine'', which inaugurated the influence of another unfavorable review. Rounding off what American readers were told about the British reception, in January ''Harper's Monthly Magazine'' attempted some damage control, and wrote that the book had  " excited a general interest "  among the London magazines.  Parker (1988), 712–723. Quotation on 713.  
 
 The most influential American review, ranked according to the number of references to it, appeared in the weekly magazine ''Literary World'', which had printed Melville's  " Mosses "  essay the preceding year. The author of the unsigned review in two installments, on November 15 and 22, was later identified as publisher Evert Duyckinck.  Parker (2002), 22   The first half of the first installment was devoted to an event of remarkable coincidence: early in the month, between the publishing of the British and the American edition, a whale had sunk the New Bedford whaler ''Ann Alexander'' near Chile.  Parker (2002), 23  
 
 In the second installment, Duyckinck described ''Moby-Dick'' as three books rolled into one: he was pleased with the book as far as it was a thorough account of the sperm whale, less so with it as far as the adventures of the ''Pequod'' crew were considered, perceiving the characters as unrealistic and expressing inappropriate opinions on religions, and condemned the essayistic rhapsodizing and moralizing with what he thought was little respect of what  " must be to the world the most sacred associations of life violated and defaced. "  Quoted, and summarized, in Parker (1988), 721–722   The review prompted Hawthorne to take the  " unusually aggressive step of reproving Duyckinck "  by criticizing the review in a letter to Duyckinck of December 1:  Parker (2002), 25  
 
  What a book Melville has written! It gives me an idea of much greater power than his preceding ones. It hardly seemed to me that the review of it, in the Literary World, did justice to its best points.  Quoted in Parker (1988), 691–92   
 
 The Transcendentalism | Transcendental socialist George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley published a review in the New York ''Tribune'' for November 22, in which he compared the book favorably to ''Mardi'', because the  " occasional touches of the subtle mysticism "  was not carried on to excess but kept within boundaries by the solid realism of the whaling context.  Quoted in Parker (2002), 26   Ripley was almost surely also the author of the review in ''Harper's'' for December, which saw in Ahab's quest the  " slight framework "  for something else:  " Beneath the whole story, the subtle, imaginative reader may perhaps find a pregnant allegory, intended to illustrate the mystery of human life. "  Quoted in Parker (2002), 27   Among the handful of other favorable reviews was one in the ''Albion'' on November 22 which saw the book as a blend of truth and satire.  Parker (2002), 26  
 
 Melville's friend Nathaniel Parker Willis, reviewing the book in November 29 ''Home Journal'', found it  " a very racy, spirited, curious and entertaining book ... it enlists the curiosity, excites the sympathies, and often charms the fancy " .   In December 6 ''Spirit of the Times'', editor William T. Porter praised the book, and all of Melville's five earlier works, as the writings  " of a man who is at once philosopher, painter, and poet " .   Some other, shorter reviews mixed their praise with genuine reservations about the  " irreverence and profane jesting " , as the New Haven ''Daily Palladium'' for November 17 phrased it. Many reviewers, Parker observes, had come to the conclusion that Melville was capable of producing enjoyable romances, but they could not see in him the author of great literature.  Parker (2002), 30  
 
 ==Legacy and adaptations== 
  
 Within a year after Melville's death in 1891, ''Moby-Dick'', along with ''Typee'', ''Omoo'', and ''Mardi'', was reprinted by Harper and Row|Harper  &  Brothers, giving it a chance to be rediscovered. However, only New York's literary underground showed interest, just enough to keep Melville's name circulating for the next 25 years in the capital of American publishing. During this time, a few critics were willing to devote time, space, and a modicum of praise to Melville and his works, or at least those that could still be easily obtained or remembered. Other works, especially the poetry, went largely forgotten.    
 
 In 1917, American literature|American author Carl Van Doren became the first of this period to proselytize about Melville's value in his 1921 study, ''The American Novel'', calling ''Moby-Dick'' a pinnacle of American Romanticism.  
 
 In his 1923 idiosyncratic but influential ''Studies in Classic American Literature'', novelist, poet, and short story writer D. H. Lawrence celebrated the originality and value of American authors, among them Melville. Perhaps surprisingly, Lawrence saw ''Moby-Dick'' as a work of the first order despite his using the expurgated original English edition which also lacked the epilogue.  
 
 The Modern Library brought out ''Moby-Dick'' in 1926 and the Lakeside Press in Chicago commissioned Rockwell Kent#Biography|Rockwell Kent to design and illustrate a striking three-volume edition which appeared in 1930. Random House then issued a one-volume trade version of Kent's edition, which in 1943 they reprinted as a less expensive Modern Library Giant.  , pp. [ & pg=PA131 & dq=Rockwell+Kent+Moby-dick+lakeside & hl=en & sa=X & ei=UFHUVK3lGoWQyAT84YDQCg & ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage & q=Rockwell%20Kent%20Moby-dick%20lakeside & f=false 107, 132, 200]  
 
 The novel has been adapted or represented in art, film, books, cartoons, television, and more than a dozen versions in comic-book format. The first adaptation was the 1926 silent movie ''The Sea Beast'', starring John Barrymore,  [ IMDb link]   in which Ahab returns to marry his fiancée after killing the whale.  Bryant and Springer (2007), xxiii–xxv.   The most famous adaptation was the John Huston Moby Dick (1956 film)|1956 film produced from a screenplay by author Ray Bradbury.     The long list of adaptations, as Bryant and Springer put it, demonstrates that  " the iconic image of an angry embittered American slaying a mythic beast seemed to capture the popular imagination. "  They conclude that  " different readers in different periods of popular culture have rewritten ''Moby-Dick'' "  to make it a  " true cultural icon " .   American artist David Klamen has cited the novel as an important influence on his dark, slow-to-disclose paintings, noting a passage in the book in which a mysterious, undecipherable painting in a bar is gradually revealed to depict a whale.  Schultz, Elizabeth. Unpainted to the Last: ''Moby-Dick and Twentieth Century American Art'', University Press of Kansas, 1995, p.329-330.  
 
 American author Ralph Ellison wrote a tribute to the book in the prologue of his 1952 novel ''Invisible Man''. The narrator remembers a moment of truth under the influence of marijuana and evokes a church service:  " Brothers and sisters, my text this morning is the 'Blackness of Blackness.' And the congregation answers: 'That blackness is most black, brother, most black & nbsp;... ' "  This scene, Ellison biographer Arnold Rampersad observes,  " reprises a moment in the second chapter of ''Moby-Dick'' " , where Ishmael wanders around New Bedford looking for a place to spend the night, and momentarily joins a congregation:  " It was a negro church; and the preacher's text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there. "  According to Rampersad, it was Melville who  " empowered Ellison to insist on a place in the American literary tradition "  by his example of  " representing the complexity of race and racism so acutely and generously in his text " .  Rampersad (1997), 172–173   Rampersad also believes Ellison's choice of a first-person narrator was inspired above all by ''Moby-Dick'', and the novel even has a similar opening sentence with the narrator introducing himself ( " I am an invisible man " ).  Rampersad (2007), 197   The oration by Ellison's blind preacher Barbee resembles Father Mapple's sermon in that both prepare the reader for what is to come.  Rampersad (2007), 228  
 
 American songwriter Bob Dylan's Nobel Prize Acceptance Speech of 2017 cited ''Moby-Dick'' as one of the three books that influenced him most. Dylan's description  ends with an acknowledgment:  " That theme, and all that it implies, would work its way into more than a few of my songs. "  Bob Dylan, [ 2016 Nobel Lecture in Literature]. Discussion of Moby-Dick at 6:30–12:30, quotation at 12:22–12:29.
