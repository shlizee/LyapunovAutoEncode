 ==History== 
 The first edition was published in 1891 by West Publishing, while the second edition was published in 1910.     The sixth and earlier editions of the book additionally provided case citations for the term cited, which was viewed by lawyers as its most useful feature, providing a useful starting point with leading cases. The invention of the Internet made legal research easier therefore many state- or circuit-specific case citations and outdated or overruled case citations were omitted from the seventh edition in 1999. The eighth edition introduced a unique system of perpetually updated case citations and cross-references to legal encyclopedias. The current edition is the eleventh, published in 2019.    
 
 As many legal terms are derived from a Latin root word, the dictionary provides a pronunciation guide for such terms.  Macleod, P. R. (1997). Latin in legal writing: an inquiry into the use of Latin in the modern legal world. ''BCL Rev.'', ''39'', 235.   In addition, the applicable entries provide pronunciation transcriptions pursuant to those found among North American practitioners of law or medicine.

 The second edition of ''Black's Law Dictionary'' (1910) is now in the public domain and could be read online for free (see External Links below). However, to be able to use this online, one must reach a certain age. The dictionary applies for legal theory terms, and many basic legal terms with respect to their general meaning. References to case law will be incomplete for modern purposes, and the use of legal language in court filings and in the courtroom has changed with changes in law and legal culture over time.  Example:  " ''libelant'' : Formerly the party who filed an initiatory Pleading (a formal declaration of a claim) in an ecclesiastical or religious matter or in an admiralty case, corresponding to the plaintiff in actions at law. 
 Since 1966, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Supplementary Admiralty Rules have governed admiralty actions, which are presently commenced by complaint [or the ''complainant''].
