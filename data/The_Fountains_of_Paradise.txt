Set in the 22nd century, it describes the construction of a space elevator. This  " orbital tower "  is a giant structure rising from the ground and linking with a satellite in geostationary orbit at the height of approximately 36,000 kilometers (approx. 22,300 miles). Such a structure would be used to raise payloads to orbit without the expense of using rockets. The novel won both the  Hugo     and Nebula     Awards for Best Novel. 
 
 ==Plot== 
 ===Summary=== 
 The novel focuses primarily on a project proposed by the main character, Vannevar Morgan, known as the Orbital Tower. The tower is to stretch from the Earth's equator to a satellite that is in geostationary orbit. Such a structure would greatly reduce the cost of sending people and supplies into space.  
 
 The main story is framed by two other stories. The first one tells of King Kalidasa, living thousands of years before Morgan is born, who is constructing a large tower. The other story, taking place long after Morgan has died, deals with aliens making contact with Earth.  
 
 Due to many technical issues, there are only two locations on Earth where the Orbital Tower can be built. One is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, and the other is Sri Kanda (now Sri Lanka). However, there is a Buddhist temple on the island, and Mahanayake Thero, the head of the order, refuses to give permission to begin construction.  
 
 Hearing of the difficulties, a group of people living on Mars contacts Morgan and suggests that the tower be built there instead. It would be smaller than the one planned for the Earth and reach from Mars to one of its moons, Deimos.  
 
 After a few setbacks, including some fatalities, construction of the tower gets underway. Although the engineer's heart is failing, he rides up the tower to take food and oxygen to a group of stranded students and their professor. After overcoming serious difficulties he succeeds, then dies of a heart attack on the way back down. 
 
 ==Themes== 
 The main theme of the novel is preceded by, and to some extent juxtaposed with, the story of the life and death of King Kashyapa I of Sri Lanka (fictionalized as King Kalidasa). It foreshadows the exploits of Vannevar Morgan in his determination to realize the space elevator. 
 
 Other subplots include human colonization of the Solar system and the First contact (science fiction)|first contact with extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial intelligence. 
 
 Clarke envisions a microscopically thin (in his demonstrator sample) but strong  " hyperfilament "  that makes the elevator possible. Although the hyperfilament is constructed from  " continuous pseudo-one-dimensional diamond crystal " , Clarke later expressed his belief that another type of carbon, Fullerene|Buckminsterfullerene, would play the role of hyperfilament in a real space elevator. The Timeline of carbon nanotubes|latest developments in carbon nanotube technology bring the orbital elevator closer to possible realisation. 
 
 ==Setting== 
 The story is set in the fictional equatorial island country of Taprobana|Taprobane, which Clarke has described as  " about ninety percent congruent with the island of Sri Lanka " , south of its real-world location. The ruins of the palace at Yakkagala as described in the book very closely match the real-life ruins at Sigiriya in Sri Lanka. The mountain on which the space elevator is built is called Sri Kanda in the book, and bears a strong resemblance to the real mountain Sri Pada. 
 
 ==Similarities with other works of Clarke== 
 * In the middle of ''The Fountains of Paradise'', an unmanned robotic spaceship of alien origin, called  " Starglider "  (from an origin world dubbed  " Starholme " ) by Clarke, passes through the Solar system. This situation is similar to ''Rendezvous with Rama'', though the ship exterior and its interactions with humans are very different. 
 * The first third of ''3001: The Final Odyssey'' describes details of the interior of the ring habitat that encircles Earth, and is connected to Earth's surface with four space elevators. At the end of ''The Fountains of Paradise'', this ring habitat is shown for the first time, though it has six space elevators rather than the four of ''3001: Final Odyssey''. 
 * At the end of the novel, Earth turns into an icy wasteland because the Sun has cooled. The same situation also occurs in the story  " History Lesson " . 
 * The alien shown near the end of ''The Fountains of Paradise'' is a somewhat more physical form of the Swarm, the aliens that land on primeval Earth in  " The Possessed (short story)|The Possessed " . 
 * A space elevator is also constructed in the course of Clarke's final novel (co-written with Frederik Pohl), ''The Last Theorem''.
