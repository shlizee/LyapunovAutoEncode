 ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling. The first novel in the ''Harry Potter'' series and Rowling's debut novel, it follows Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter, a young Wizard (fantasy)|wizard who discovers his magical heritage on his eleventh birthday, when he receives a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry makes close friends and a few enemies during his first year at the school, and with the help of his friends, Harry faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents, but failed to kill Harry when he was just 15 months old. 
 
 The book was first published in the United Kingdom on 26 June 1997 by Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury. It was published in the United States the following year by Scholastic Corporation under the title ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone''. It won most of the British book awards that were judged by children and other awards in the US. The book reached the top of the ''New York Times'' list of best-selling fiction in August 1999 and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000. It has been translated into at least 73 other languages, and has been made into a Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|feature-length film of the same name, as have all six of its sequels. The novel has sold in excess of 120 million copies.       
 
 Most reviews were very favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, although a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing has been compared to that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors; Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter; and the Ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues, as well as overcoming obstacles like bullies. 
 
 ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', along with the rest of the ''Harry Potter'' series, has been attacked by some religious groups and banned in some countries because of accusations that the novels promote witchcraft under the guise of a heroic, moral story.  Other religious commentators have written that the book exemplifies important viewpoints, including the power of self-sacrifice and the ways in which people's decisions shape their personalities. The series has been used as a source of wikt:object lesson|object lessons in Education#Teaching|educational techniques, sociology|sociological analysis and marketing. 
 
 ==Synopsis== 
 ===Plot=== 
  
 
 Harry Potter has been living a difficult life, constantly abused by his cold aunt and uncle, Dursley family|Vernon and Petunia Dursley and bullied by their spoiled son Dudley since the death of his parents ten years prior. His life changes on the day of his eleventh birthday when he receives a letter of acceptance into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, delivered by a half-giant named Rubeus Hagrid after previous letters had been destroyed by Vernon and Petunia. Hagrid details Harry's past as the son of James Potter (character)|James and Lily Potter, who were a wizard and witch respectively, and how they were murdered by the most evil and powerful dark wizard of all time, Lord Voldemort, which resulted in the one-year-old Harry being sent to live with his aunt and uncle. Voldemort was not only unable to kill Harry, but his powers were also destroyed in the attempt, forcing him into exile and sparking Harry's immense fame among the magical community. 
 
 Hagrid introduces Harry to the wizarding world by bringing him to Diagon Alley, a hidden street in London, where Harry uncovers a fortune left to him by his parents at Gringotts Wizarding Bank. He also receives a pet owl, Hedwig, various school supplies, and a wand (which he learns shares a core from the same source as Voldemort's wand). There, he is surprised to discover how famous he truly is among witches and wizards as  " The Boy Who Lived " . A month later, Harry leaves the Dursleys' home to catch the Hogwarts Express from London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross railway station's secret Hogwarts platform, Platform 9¾|Platform . On the train, he quickly befriends fellow first-year Ronald Weasley and the two boys meet Hermione Granger, whose snobbiness and affinity for spells initially causes the two boys to dislike her. There, Harry also makes an enemy of yet another first-year, Draco Malfoy, who shows prejudice against Ron for his family's financial difficulties. 
 
 Arriving at Hogwarts, the first-years are assigned by the magical Sorting Hat to House system|Houses that best suit their personalities, the four Houses being Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw. Harry hears from Ron about Slytherin's dark reputation which is known to house potential dark witches and wizards, and thus objects to being sorted into Slytherin despite the Hat claiming that Harry has potential to develop under that House. He winds up in Gryffindor with Ron and Hermione, while Draco is sorted into Slytherin like his family before him. 
 
 As classes begin at Hogwarts, Harry discovers he has a talent for Broom#Magic|flying on broomsticks, and is recruited into his House's team for Quidditch (a sport sharing similarities to Association football|football) as a Seeker. He also comes to dislike the school's Potions master, Severus Snape, who is also the Head of Slytherin House who acts with bias in favour of members of his House while perpetually looking for opportunities to fail Harry and his friends. Malfoy tricks Harry and Ron into a duel in the trophy room to get them out of their rooms at night and secretly tells Filch, the school's caretaker, where they will be. Hermione unintentionally is forced to come along after her failed attempts to stop them, and they find Gryffindor student Neville Longbottom asleep outside the common area because he had forgotten the password to get in. After realizing the duel was a set-up to get them in trouble, they run away. They then discover a huge three-headed dog standing guard over a trapdoor in a forbidden corridor. The school's Halloween celebrations are interrupted by the entrance of a troll into the school, which enters the girls' bathroom where Hermione was. However, she is saved by Harry and Ron and, as a result, Hermione is grateful and the three become best friends. Coupled with Snape's recent leg injury as well as behaviour, the recent events prompt Harry, Hermione and Ron to suspect him to be looking for a way to enter the trapdoor. 
 
 Hermione forbids the boys from investigating for fear of expulsion, and instead makes Harry direct his attention to his first ever Quidditch game, where his broomstick begins to lose control and threatens to throw him off. This leads Hermione to suspect that Snape had jinxed Harry's broom, due to his strange behaviour during the match. After the excitement of winning the match has died down, Christmas arrives and Harry receives an invisibility cloak from an anonymous source claiming that the cloak belonged to Harry's father. Using the cloak to explore the school at night to investigate what is under the trapdoor, he discovers the Mirror of Erised, in which the viewer sees his or her deepest desires come true. Within the Mirror, Harry sees himself standing with both of his parents. 
 
 A visit to Hagrid's hut at the foot of the school leads the trio to find a newspaper report stating there had been an attempted robbery of a Gringotts vault—the same vault that Hagrid and Harry had visited when the latter was getting his school supplies. A further indiscretion from Hagrid allows them to work out that the object kept under that trapdoor is a Philosopher's Stone, which grants its user immortality as well as the ability to turn any metal into pure gold. Harry is also informed by a centaur named Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Firenze|Firenze in the forest that a plot to steal the Stone is being orchestrated by none other than Voldemort himself, who schemes to use it to be restored back to his body and return to power. When the school's headmaster Albus Dumbledore is lured from Hogwarts under false pretences, Harry, Hermione and Ron fear that the theft is imminent and descend through the trapdoor themselves. 
 
 They encounter a series of obstacles, each of which requires unique skills possessed by one of the three, one of which requires Ron to sacrifice himself in a life-sized game of wizard's chess. In the final room, Harry, now alone, finds Quirinus Quirrell, the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, who reveals he had been the one working behind the scenes to kill Harry by first jinxing his broom and then letting a troll into the school, while Snape had been trying to protect Harry instead. Quirrell is helping Voldemort, whose face has sprouted on the back of Quirrell's head but is constantly concealed by his oversized turban, to attain the Philosopher's Stone so as to restore his body. Quirrell uses Harry to get past the final obstacle, the Mirror of Erised, by forcing him to stand before the Mirror. It recognises Harry's lack of greed for the Stone and surreptitiously deposits it into his pocket. As Quirrell attempts to seize the stone and kill Harry, his flesh burns on contact with the boy's skin and breaks into blisters. Harry's scar suddenly burns with pain and he passes out. 
 
 Three days later, he awakens in the school's infirmary, where Dumbledore explains his survival against Voldemort is due to his mother's sacrificing her life in order for him to live. This left a powerful protective charm on Harry that lives in his blood, which caused Quirrell's hands to burn on contact with Harry due to him being possessed by hatred and greed. He also reveals himself as the one who sent Harry his father's invisibility cloak, while Quirrell has been left to die by Voldemort, who still lives, and the Stone has now been destroyed. The eventful school year ends at the final feast, during which Gryffindor wins the House Cup. Harry returns to Privet Drive for the summer, neglecting to tell the Dursleys that the use of spells is forbidden by under-aged wizards and witches and thus anticipating some fun and peace over the holidays. 
 
 ===Main characters=== 
  
 * Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter is an orphan whom Rowling imagined as a  " scrawny, black-haired, green eyed and bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard. "     She developed the series' story and characters to explain how Harry came to be in this situation and how his life unfolded from there.     Apart from the first chapter, the events of this book take place just before and in the year following Harry's eleventh birthday.   Voldemort's attack left a lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead,    which produces stabbing pains whenever Voldemort is present.   Harry has a natural talent for Quidditch and became the first person in a century to get on their team in their first year.  
 * Ron Weasley|Ronald Weasley is Harry's age and Rowling describes him as the ultimate best friend,  " always there when you need him. "     He is freckled, red-haired and quite tall. He grew up in a fairly large pure-blood family as the sixth born of seven children. Although his family is quite poor, they still live comfortably and happily. His loyalty and bravery in the face of a game of Wizards Chess plays a vital part in finding the Philosopher's Stone. 
 * Hermione Granger, the daughter of an all-Muggle family, is a bossy girl   who has apparently memorised most of the textbooks before the start of term.   Rowling described Hermione as a  " very logical, upright and good "  character     with  " a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness " .   Despite her nagging efforts to keep Harry and Ron out of trouble,   she becomes a close friend of the two boys after they save her from a troll,   and her magical and analytical skills play an important role in finding the Philosopher's Stone.   She has bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth. 
 * Neville Longbottom is a plump, diffident boy,   so forgetful that his grandmother gives him a Remembrall, to remind him if he forgets something.   Neville's magical abilities are weak and appeared just in time to save his life when he was eight.   Despite his timidity, Neville will fight anyone after some encouragement   or if he thinks it is right and important.  
 * Rubeus Hagrid, a half-giant nearly  tall, with tangled black hair and beard,   was expelled from Hogwarts and his magic wand|wand was snapped in half (resulting in him never to use a wand again), however Professor Dumbledore let him stay on as the school's gamekeeper,   a job which enables him to lavish affection, care and even pet names on even the most dangerous of magical creatures.   Hagrid is fiercely loyal to Dumbledore   and quickly becomes a close friend of Harry, Ron   and, later, Hermione,   but his carelessness makes him unreliable.  
 * Professor Dumbledore|Professor Albus Dumbledore, a tall, thin man who wears half-moon spectacles and has silver hair and a beard that tucks into his belt,   is the headmaster of Hogwarts,   and thought to be the only wizard Voldemort fears.   Dumbledore, while renowned for his achievements in magic,   shrugs off praise,   though he is aware of his own brilliance.   Rowling described him as the  " epitome of goodness " .    
 * Professor McGonagall|Professor Minerva McGonagall, a tall, severe-looking woman with black hair tied in a tight Bun (hairstyle)|bun,   teaches Transfiguration (Harry Potter)|Transfiguration, and is able to transform herself into a cat.   She is Deputy Headmistress, and Head of Gryffindor House and, according to the author,  " under that gruff exterior "  is  " a bit of an old softy " .    
 * Petunia Dursley, the sister of Harry's mother Lily Potter|Lily, is a thin woman with a long neck that she uses for spying on the neighbours.   As a muggle, she regards her magical sister as a freak   and tries to pretend that she never existed.  
 * Vernon Dursley, the husband of Petunia Dursley, is a heavily built man whose irascible bluster   covers a narrow mind and a fear of anything unusual. 
 * Dudley Dursley is an overweight, spoiled bully and Harry's cousin.  
 * Draco Malfoy is a slim, pale boy   who speaks in a bored drawl.   He is arrogant about his skill in Quidditch,   and despises anyone who is not a pure-blood wizard  & nbsp;– and wizards who do not share his views.   His parents had supported Voldemort, but changed sides after the dark wizard's disappearance, claiming they had been Imperius Curse|bewitched.   Draco avoids direct confrontations, and tries to get Harry and his friends into trouble.  
 * Oliver Wood (Harry Potter)|Oliver Wood is Harry's Quidditch captain and keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. 
 * Professor Quirrell is a twitching, stammering and nervous man who teaches Defence Against the Dark Arts.   Reputedly he was a brilliant scholar, but his nerve was shattered by an encounter with vampires.   Quirrell wears a turban   to conceal the fact that he is voluntarily possessed by Voldemort,   whose face appears on the back of Quirrell's head.  
 * Severus Snape|Professor Severus Snape, who has a hooked nose, sallow complexion and greasy black hair,   teaches Potions Class|Potions, but would prefer to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts. Snape favours pupils in Slytherin, his own House, and seizes every opportunity to humiliate others, especially Harry.   Several incidents, beginning with the shooting pain in Harry's scar during the start-of-term feast,   lead Harry and his friends to think Snape is aiding Voldemort.  
 * Argus Filch, the school caretaker who knows the school's Hogwarts#Passages|secret passages better than anyone else except, perhaps, the Weasley twins.   His cat, Mrs. Norris, aids his constant hunt for misbehaving pupils.  
 
 Other members of staff include the dumpy Magic in Harry Potter#Herbology|Herbology teacher and Head of Hufflepuff House Professor Sprout,    Professor Flitwick, the tiny and excitable Magic in Harry Potter#Charms|Charms teacher, and Head of Ravenclaw House,   the soporific Magic in Harry Potter#History of Magic|History of Magic teacher, Professor Binns, a ghost who does not seem to have noticed his own death;   and Madam Hooch, the Quidditch coach, who is strict, but a considerate and methodical teacher.   -- >  The poltergeist Peeves wanders around the castle causing trouble wherever he can.  
 
 In the book, Rowling introduces an eclectic cast of characters. The first character to be introduced is Vernon Dursley, Harry's uncle. Most of the actions centre on the eponymous hero Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter, an orphan who escapes his miserable childhood with the Dursley family. Rowling imagined him as a  " scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard " ,   and says she transferred part of her pain about losing her mother to him.   During the book, Harry makes two close friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron is described by Rowling as the ultimate best friend,  " always there when you need him " .   Rowling has described Hermione as a  " very logical, upright and good "  character   with  " a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness " .  
 
 Rowling also imagined a supporting cast of adults. The headmaster of Hogwarts is the powerful, but kind wizard Albus Dumbledore, who becomes Harry's confidant. Rowling described him as  " epitome of goodness " .   His right hand is severe Minerva McGonagall, who according to the author  " under that gruff exterior "  is  " a bit of an old softy " ,   the friendly half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, who saved Harry from the Dursley family, and the sinister Severus Snape.     Professor Quirrell is also featured in the novel. 
 
 The main antagonists are Draco Malfoy, an elitist, bullying classmate     and Lord Voldemort, the most powerful evil wizard who becomes disembodied when he tries to kill baby Harry. According to a 1999 interview with Rowling, the character of Voldemort was created as a literary foil for Harry, and his backstory was intentionally not fleshed-out at first: 
 
  
 
 ==Development, publication and reception== 
 ===Development=== 
 
 The book, which was Rowling's debut novel, was written between approximately June 1990 and some time in 1995. In 1990 Jo Rowling, as she preferred to be known,   The book's copyright page gives her name as  " Joanne Rowling " .    }} wanted to move with her boyfriend to a flat in Manchester and in her words,  " One weekend after flat hunting, I took the train back to London on my own and the idea for Harry Potter fell into my head... A scrawny, little, black-haired, bespectacled boy became more and more of a wizard to me... I began to write ''Philosopher's Stone'' that very evening. Although, the first couple of pages look nothing like the finished product. "     Then Rowling's mother died and, to cope with her pain, Rowling transferred her own anguish to the orphan Harry.   Rowling spent six years working on ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', and after it was accepted by Bloomsbury, she obtained a grant of £8,000 from the Scottish Arts Council, which enabled her to plan the sequels.     She sent the book to an Literary agent|agent and a publisher, and then the second agent she approached spent a year trying to sell the book to publishers, most of whom thought it was too long at about 90,000 & nbsp;words. Barry Cunningham (publisher)|Barry Cunningham, who was building a portfolio of distinctive fantasies by new authors for Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury Children's Books, recommended accepting the book,   and the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chief executive said it was  " so much better than anything else " .

 Bloomsbury accepted the book, paying Rowling a £2,500 Advance payment|advance,     and Cunningham sent Galley proof|proof copies to carefully chosen authors, critics and booksellers in order to obtain comments that could be quoted when the book was launched.   He was less concerned about the book's length than about its author's name, since the title sounded like a boys' book to him, and he believed boys preferred books by male authors. Rowling therefore adopted the ''nom de plume'' J.K. Rowling just before publication.   In June 1997, Bloomsbury published ''Philosopher's Stone'' with an initial print-run of 500 copies in hardback, three hundred of which were distributed to libraries.     Her original name,  " Joanne Rowling " , can be found in small print on the copyright page of this first British edition. (The 1998 first American edition would remove reference to  " Joanne "  completely.)     The short initial print run was standard for first novels, and Cunningham hoped booksellers would read the book and recommend it to customers.   Examples from this initial print run have sold for as much as US$33,460 in a 2007 Heritage Auctions|Heritage Auction.    
 
 Lindsey Fraser, who had previously supplied one of the blurb comments,     wrote what is thought to be the first published review, in ''The Scotsman'' on 28 June 1997. She described ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' as  " a hugely entertaining thriller "  and Rowling as  " a first-rate writer for children " .      Another early review, in ''The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald'', said,  " I have yet to find a child who can put it down. "  Newspapers outside Scotland started to notice the book, with glowing reviews in ''The Guardian'' and ''The Sunday Times'', and in September 1997 ''Books for Keeps'', a magazine that specialised in children's books, gave the novel four stars out of five.   ''Sunday Times'' said  " comparisons to Dahl are, this time, justified " , while ''The Guardian'' called it  " a richly textured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit "  and ''The Scotsman'' said it had  " all the makings of a classic " .  
 
 In 1997 the UK edition won a Specsavers National Book Awards|National Book Award and a gold medal in the 9- to 11-year-olds category of the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize.     The ''Smarties'' award, which is voted for by children, made the book well known within six months of publication, while most children's books have to wait for years.   The following year, ''Philosopher's Stone'' won almost all the other major British awards that were decided by children.   It was also shortlisted for children's books awards adjudicated by adults,     but did not win. Sandra Beckett commented that books which were popular with children were regarded as undemanding and as not of the highest literary standards & nbsp;– for example the literary establishment disdained the works of Dahl, an overwhelming favourite of children before the appearance of Rowling's books.   In 2003, the novel was listed at number 22 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.  [  " BBC & nbsp;– The Big Read " ] . BBC. April 2003, Retrieved 12 December 2013  
 
 ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' won two publishing industry awards given for sales rather than literary merit, the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year and the Booksellers' Association / ''Bookseller'' Author of the Year.   By March 1999 UK editions had sold just over 300,000 copies,     and the story was still the UK's best-selling title in December 2001.     A Braille edition was published in May 1998 by the Scottish Braille Press.

 Scholastic Corporation bought the U.S. rights at the Bologna Children's Book Fair|Bologna Book Fair in April 1997 for US$105,000, an unusually high sum for a children's book.   Scholastic's Arthur Levine thought that  " philosopher "  sounded too archaic for readers     and after some discussion (including the proposed title  " Harry Potter and the School of Magic "    ), the American edition was published in September 1998     under the title Rowling suggested, ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone''.   Rowling later said that she regretted this change and would have fought it if she had been in a stronger position at the time.     Philip Nel has pointed out that the change lost the connection with alchemy, and the meaning of some other terms changed in translation, for example from  " crumpet "  to  " muffin " . While Rowling accepted the change from both the British English  " mum "  and Seamus Finnigan's Irish variant  " mam "  to  " mom "  in ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'', she vetoed this change in the later books, which was then reversed in later editions of ''Philosopher's Stone''. However, Nel considered that Scholastic's translations were considerably more sensitive than most of those imposed on British English books of the time, and that some other changes could be regarded as useful copyedits.     Since the British editions of early titles in the series were published months prior to the American versions, some American readers became familiar with the British English versions owing to having bought them from online retailers.

 At first the most prestigious reviewers ignored the book, leaving it to book trade and library publications such as ''Kirkus Reviews'' and ''Booklist'', which examined it only by the entertainment-oriented criteria of children's fiction. However, more penetrating specialist reviews (such as one by ''Cooperative Children's Book Center Choices'', which pointed out the complexity, depth and consistency of the world that Rowling had world-building|built) attracted the attention of reviewers in major newspapers.   Although ''The Boston Globe'' and Michael Winerip in ''The New York Times'' complained that the final chapters were the weakest part of the book,      they and most other American reviewers gave glowing praise.   
     However he felt that the story-telling in the last few chapters was poor, and also did not appreciate characters behaving unlike themselves to advance the plot.   In 1998, Publishers Weekly described the novel as  " A delightful award-winning debut from an author who dances in the footsteps of P.L. Travers and Roald Dahl. "    
 -- > 
 A year later, the US edition was selected as an American Library Association Notable Book, a ''Publishers Weekly'' Best Book of 1998, and a New York Public Library 1998 Best Book of the Year, and won ''Parenting Magazines Book of the Year Award for 1998,   the School Library Journal Best Book of the Year, and the American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults.  
 
 In August 1999, ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' topped the ''New York Times'' list of best-selling fiction,     and stayed near the top of the list for much of 1999 and 2000, until the ''New York Times'' split its list into children's and adult sections under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher placings.        ''Publishers Weeklys report in December 2001 on cumulative sales of children's fiction placed ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' 19th among hardbacks (over 5 million copies) and 7th among paperbacks (over 6.6 & nbsp;million copies).    
 
 In May 2008, Scholastic announced the creation of a 10th Anniversary Edition of the book     that was released on 1 October 2008     to mark the tenth anniversary of the original American release.   For the fifteenth anniversary of the books, Scholastic re-released ''Sorcerer's Stone'', along with the other six novels in the series, with new cover art by Kazu Kibuishi in 2013.          
 
 ===Translations=== 
  
 
 By mid-2008, official translations of the book had been published in 67 languages.        By November 2017, the book had been translated into 80 languages, the 80th being Scots language|Lowland Scots.     Bloomsbury have published translations in Latin and in Ancient Greek,        with the latter being described as  " one of the most important pieces of Ancient Greek prose written in many centuries " .    
 
 ==Style and themes== 
  
 
 Philip Nel highlighted the influence of Jane Austen, whom Rowling has greatly admired since the age of twelve. Both novelists greatly encourage re-reading, because details that look insignificant foreshadow important events or characters much later in the story-line & nbsp;– for example Sirius Black is briefly mentioned near the beginning of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', and then becomes a major character in the third to fifth books. Like Austen's heroines, Harry often has to re-examine his ideas near the ends of books. Some social behaviour in the ''Harry Potter'' books is remininiscent of Austen, for example the excited communal reading of letters. Both authors satire|satirise social behaviour and give characters names that express their personalities. However in Nel's opinion Rowling's humour is more based on caricature and the names she invents are more like those found in Charles Dickens|Charles Dickens's stories,   and Amanda Cockrell noted that many of these express their owners' traits through allusions that run from ancient Roman mythology to eighteenth-century German literature.     Rowling, like the The Chronicles of Narnia|Narnia series' author C.S. Lewis, thinks there is no rigid distinction between stories for children and for adults. Nel also noted that, like many good writers for children, Rowling combines literary genresfantasy, young adult fiction, boarding school stories, ''Bildungsroman'' and many others.   
 
 Some reviewers compared ''Philosopher's Stone'' to the stories of Roald Dahl, who died in 1990. Many writers since the 1970s had been hailed as his successor, but none had attained anything near his popularity with children and, in a poll conducted shortly after the launch of ''Philosopher's Stone'', seven of the ten most popular children's books were by Dahl, including the one in top place. The only other really popular children's author of the late 1990s was an American, R. L. Stine. Some of the story elements in ''Philosopher's Stone'' resembled parts of Dahl's stories. For example, the hero of ''James and the Giant Peach'' lost his parents and had to live with a pair of unpleasant auntsone fat and one thin rather like Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, who treated Harry as a servant. However Harry Potter was a distinctive creation, able to take on the responsibilities of an adult while remaining a child inside.  
 
 Librarian Nancy Knapp and marketing professor Stephen Brown noted the liveliness and detail of descriptions, especially of shop scenes such as Diagon Alley.    Tad Brennan commented that Rowling's writing resembles that of Homer:  " rapid, plain, and direct in expression. "   Stephen King admired  " the sort of playful details of which only British fantasists seem capable "  and concluded that they worked because Rowling enjoys a quick giggle and then moves briskly forward.    
 
 Nicholas Tucker described the early ''Harry Potter'' books as looking back to Victorian literature|Victorian and Edwardian children's stories: Hogwarts was an old-style boarding school in which the teachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned with the reputations of the houses with which they were associated; characters' personalities were plainly shown by their appearances, starting with the Dursleys; evil or malicious characters were to be crushed rather than reformed, including Argus Filch's cat Mrs Norris; and the hero, a mistreated orphan who found his true place in life, was charismatic and good at sports, but considerate and protective towards the weak.     Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly Social stratification|stratified society including many social stereotypes.     However Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts' students; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species; and school bullying.    
 
 Susan Hall wrote that there is no rule of law in the books, as the actions of Ministry of Magic officials are unconstrained by laws, accountability or any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for Voldemort to offer his own horrific version of order. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards. For example, Hermione notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards have no chance of solving it.    
 
 Nel suggested that the unflattering characterisation of the extremely conventional, social status|status-conscious, materialistic Dursleys was Rowling's reaction to the family policies of the British government in the early 1990s, which treated the married heterosexual couple as the  " preferred norm " , while the author was a single parent|single mother. Harry's relationships with adult and juvenile wizards are based on affection and loyalty. This is reflected in his happiness whenever he is a temporary member of the Weasley family throughout the series, and in his treatment of first Rubeus Hagrid and later Remus Lupin and Sirius Black as father-figures.

 ===Uses in education and business=== 
 
 Writers on education and business subjects have used the book as an . Writing about clinical teaching in medical schools, Jennifer Conn contrasted Snape's technical expertise with his intimidating behaviour towards students. Quidditch coach Madam Hooch on the other hand, illustrated useful techniques in the teaching of physical skills, including breaking down complex actions into sequences of simple ones and helping students to avoid common errors.     Joyce Fields wrote that the books illustrate four of the five main topics in a typical first-year sociology class:  " sociological concepts including culture, society, and socialisation; stratification and social inequality; social institutions; and social theory " .  
 
 Stephen Brown noted that the early ''Harry Potter'' books, especially ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', were a runaway success despite inadequate and poorly organised marketing. Brown advised marketing executives to be less preoccupied with rigorous statistical analyses and the  " analysis, planning, implementation, and control "  model of management. Instead he recommended that they should treat the stories as  " a marketing masterclass " , full of enticing products and brand names.     For example, a real-world analogue of Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans was introduced Licence#Trademark and brand licensing|under licence in 2000 by toymaker Hasbro.
