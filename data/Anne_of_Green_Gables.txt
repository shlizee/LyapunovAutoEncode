 == Background == 
 File:Eickemeyer nesbit.jpg|thumb|The portrait of Evelyn Nesbit by Rudolf Eickemeyer Jr. which inspired Montgomery.   
 In writing the novel, Montgomery was inspired by notes she had made as a young girl about two siblings  who were mistakenly sent an orphan girl instead of the boy they had requested, yet decided to keep her. She drew upon her own childhood experiences in rural Prince Edward Island, Canada. Montgomery used a photograph of Evelyn Nesbit, which she had clipped from New York's ''Metropolitan Magazine (New York)|Metropolitan Magazine'' and put on the wall of her bedroom, as the model for the face of Anne Shirley and a reminder of her  " youthful idealism and spirituality. "    
 
 Montgomery was inspired by the  " formula Ann "  orphan stories (called such because they followed such a predictable formula) which were popular at the time and distinguished her character by spelling her name with an extra  " e " .        She based other characters, such as Gilbert Blythe, in part on people she knew. She said she wrote the novel in the twilight of the day, while sitting at her window and overlooking the fields of Cavendish, Prince Edward Island|Cavendish.    
 
 == Plot summary == 
 File:Thwack! - M.A. and W.A.J. Claus.jpg|thumb|Anne attacks Gilbert 
 Anne Shirley, a young orphan from the fictional community of Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia (based upon the real community of New London, Prince Edward Island),        is sent to live with Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, unmarried siblings in their fifties and sixties, after a childhood spent in strangers' homes and orphanages. Marilla and Matthew had originally decided to adopt a boy from the orphanage to help Matthew run their farm at Green Gables (Prince Edward Island)|Green Gables, which is set in the fictional town of Avonlea (based on Cavendish, Prince Edward Island). Through a misunderstanding, the orphanage sends Anne instead. 
 
 Anne is fanciful, imaginative, eager to please, and dramatic. She is also adamant her name should always be spelt with an e at the end. However, she is defensive about her appearance, despising her red hair, freckles and pale, thin frame, but liking her nose. She is talkative, especially when it comes to describing her fantasies and dreams. At first, stern Marilla says Anne must return to the orphanage, but after much observation and consideration, along with kind, quiet Matthew's encouragement, Marilla decides to let her stay. 
 
 Anne takes much joy in life and adapts quickly, thriving in the close-knit farming village. Her imagination and talkativeness soon brighten up Green Gables. 
 
 The book recounts Anne's struggles and joys in settling in to Green Gables (the first real home she's ever known): the country school where she quickly excels in her studies; her friendship with Diana Barry, the girl living next door (her best or  " bosom friend "  as Anne fondly calls her); her budding literary ambitions; and her rivalry with her classmate Gilbert Blythe, who teases her about her red hair. For that, he earns her instant hatred, although he apologizes several times. As time passes, however, Anne realizes she no longer hates Gilbert, but her pride and stubbornness keep her from speaking to him. 
 
 The book also follows Anne's adventures in Avonlea. Episodes include play-time with her friends Diana, calm, placid Jane Andrews, and beautiful, boy-crazy Ruby Gillis. She has run-ins with the unpleasant Pye sisters, Gertie and Josie, and frequent domestic  " scrapes "  such as dyeing her hair green while intending to dye it black, and accidentally getting Diana drunk by giving her what she thinks is raspberry Squash (drink)|cordial but which turns out to be Ribes|currant wine. 
 
 At sixteen, Anne goes to Queen's Academy to earn a teaching licence, along with Gilbert, Ruby, Josie, Jane, and several other students, excluding Diana, much to Anne's dismay. She obtains her license in one year instead of the usual two and wins the Avery Scholarship awarded to the top student in English. This scholarship would allow her to pursue a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree at the fictional Redmond College (based on the real Dalhousie University) on the mainland in Nova Scotia. 
 
 Near the end of the book, however, tragedy strikes when Matthew dies of a heart attack after learning that all of his and Marilla's money has been lost in a bank failure. Out of devotion to Marilla and Green Gables, Anne gives up the scholarship to stay at home and help Marilla, whose eyesight is failing. She plans to teach at the Carmody school, the nearest school available, and return to Green Gables on weekends. In an act of friendship, Gilbert Blythe gives up his teaching position at the Avonlea School to work at the White Sands School instead, knowing that Anne wants to stay close to Marilla after Matthew's death. After this kind act, Anne and Gilbert's friendship is cemented, and Anne looks forward to what life will bring next.

 File:There's Something So Stylish About You, Anne - M.A. and W.A.J. Claus.jpg|thumb|Diana and Anne 
 
 === Green Gables household === 
 * Anne Shirley: An imaginative, talkative, red-haired orphan who comes to live with Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert at age 11. Anne is very sensitive and dislikes the colour of her hair. Anne's bleak early childhood was spent being shuttled from orphanage to foster homes, caring for younger children. She is excited to finally have a real home at Green Gables. 
 * Marilla Cuthbert: Matthew's sister, an austere but fair woman who has the  " glimmerings of a sense of humour. "  Her life has been colourless and without joy until the arrival of Anne. She tries to instill discipline in the child but grows to love Anne's vivacity and joy. 
 * Matthew Cuthbert: Marilla's brother, a shy, kind man who takes a liking to Anne from the start. The two become fast friends and he is the first person who has ever shown Anne unconditional love. Although Marilla has primary responsibility for rearing Anne, Matthew has no qualms about  " spoiling "  her and indulging her with pretty clothes and hair dye and fancy shoes. 
 
 === Anne's friends/classmates === 
 * Diana Barry: Anne's bosom friend and a kindred spirit. Anne and Diana become best friends from the moment they meet. She is the only girl of Anne's age who lives close to Green Gables. Anne admires Diana for being pretty with black hair and flawless complexion and for her amiable disposition. Diana lacks Anne's vivid imagination but is a loyal friend. 
 * Gilbert Blythe: A handsome, smart, and witty classmate, two years older than Anne, who has a crush on her. Unaware of Anne's sensitivity about her red hair, he tries to get her attention by holding her braid and calling her  " Carrots "  in the classroom, and she breaks a slate over his head. Despite his attempts at an apology, Anne's anger and stubbornness prevent her from speaking to him for several years. By the end of the book however, they reconcile and become good friends. 
 * Ruby Gillis: Another of Anne's friends. Having several  " grown-up "  sisters, Ruby loves to share her knowledge of beaux with her friends. Ruby is beautiful, with long golden hair. 
 * Jane Andrews: One of Anne's friends from school, she is plain and sensible. She does well enough academically to join Anne's class at Queen's. 
 * Josie Pye: A classmate generally disliked by the other girls (as are her siblings), Josie is vain, dishonest, and jealous of Anne's popularity. 
 * Prissy Andrews: Another school companion of Anne's, who is assumed to be in a relationship with the teacher, Mr. Phillips. 
 
 === Avonlea's locals === 
 * Mrs. Rachel Lynde: A neighbour of Matthew and Marilla, Mrs. Lynde is a noted busybody, but is also industrious and charitable. Although she and Anne start off on the wrong foot due to Mrs. Lynde's blunt criticism and Anne's short temper, they soon become quite close. Mrs. Lynde is married to Thomas Lynde, who is mentioned several times but never appears, and has raised ten children. 
 * Mr. Phillips: Anne's first teacher at Avonlea, Mr. Phillips is unpopular with students. In Anne's case, he continually misspells her name (without the  " E " ) and punishes only her among twelve pupils who arrive late, resulting in Anne's refusal to attend school for several weeks. Once, he punished Anne for losing her temper with Gilbert Blythe. He is described as lacking discipline, and  " courts "  one of his older pupils, Prissy Andrews, openly. 
 * Miss Muriel Stacy: Anne's energetic replacement teacher. Her warm and sympathetic nature appeals to her students, but some of Avonlea's more old-fashioned parents disapprove of her teaching methods. Miss Stacy is another  " kindred spirit, "  whom Anne views as a mentor. Miss Stacy encourages Anne to develop her character and intellect and helps prepare her for the entrance exam at Queen's Academy. 
 * Mr. and Mrs. Allan: The minister and his wife also befriend Anne, with Mrs. Allan becoming particularly close. She is described as pretty and is a  " kindred spirit. " 
 * Mr.  &  Mrs. Barry: Diana's parents. Mr. Barry is unseen.  He is a farmer. Near the end of the book, he offers to rent some tracts to help out Anne and Marilla, after Matthew's death. Mrs. Barry is a strict parent. After Anne accidentally gets Diana drunk, Mrs. Barry forbids Diana to have anything to do with Anne. This sanction is repealed after Anne saves Diana's younger sister, Minnie May. 
 * Minnie May Barry: Diana's baby sister, whose life is saved by Anne when she becomes infected with croup. 
 
 === Others === 
 * Miss Josephine Barry: Diana's great-aunt. She is initially severe, but is quickly charmed and entertained by Anne's imagination, and  invites her and Diana to tea. She refers to Anne as  " the Anne-girl "  and even sends Anne beaded slippers as a Christmas present. 
 * Mrs. Hammond: Anne lives with her for a portion of her pre-Green-Gables life and cares for Mrs. Hammond's three sets of twins. Anne is sent to the Hopetown orphan asylum when Mrs. Hammond is forced to break up her home after her husband's sudden death.

 ==Adaptations==   
 
 === Films (theatrical)=== 
 The first filmed appearance of Anne Shirley was in the 1919 silent film, Anne of Green Gables (1919 film)|''Anne of Green Gables'', in which the role was played by Mary Miles Minter. The film was directed by William Desmond Taylor. As of 2011, no prints of this silent film adaptation are known to survive. The 1919 film version moved the story from Prince Edward Island to New England, which one American critic—unaware that the novel was set in Canada—praised for  " the genuine New England atmosphere called for by the story " .  Hammill, Faye  " 'A new and exceedingly brilliant star': L. M. Montgomery, ''Anne of Green Gables'', and Mary Miles Minter "  pages 652-670 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Volume 101, Issue # 3, July 2006 page 666.   Montgomery herself was infuriated with the film for changing Anne from a Canadian to an American, writing in her diary: 
 
  It was a pretty little play well photographed, but I think if I hadn't already known it was from my book, that I would never had recognized it. The landscape and folks were 'New England', never P.E Island...A skunk and an American flag were introduced-both equally unknown in PE Island. I could have shrieked with rage over the latter. Such crass, blatant Yankeeism!.   
 
 Montgomery disapproved of Minter's performance, writing she had portrayed  " a sweet, sugary heroine utterly unlike my gingerly Anne " , and complained about a scene where Shirley waved about a shotgun as something as her Anne would never do.  Hammill, Faye  " 'A new and exceedingly brilliant star': L. M. Montgomery, ''Anne of Green Gables'', and Mary Miles Minter "  pages 652-670 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Volume 101, Issue # 3, July 2006 page 667.  
 
 In the Anne of Green Gables (1934 film)|1934 adaption of the novel, Anne was portrayed by Anne Shirley (actress)|Dawn O'Day, who legally changed her name to  " Anne Shirley. "  She reprised the role in ''Anne of Windy Poplars'', a 1940 film adaption. Montgomery liked the 1934 film more than the 1919 film, not least because now the book's dialogue could be portrayed on the silver screen and that two scenes were filmed on location in Prince Edward Island (though the rest of the film was shot in California), but still charged that neither the 1919 nor 1934 versions of ''Anne of Green Gables'' quite got her book right.  Hammill, Faye  " 'A new and exceedingly brilliant star': L. M. Montgomery, ''Anne of Green Gables'', and Mary Miles Minter "  pages 652-670 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Volume 101, Issue # 3, July 2006 page 668.   Writing about the 1934 version of ''Anne of Green Gables'', Montgomery wrote in her diary that it was a  " thousand times "  better than the 1919 version, but still it:  " was so entirely different from ''my'' vision of the scenes and the people that it did not seem like ''my'' book at all " .   The British scholar Faye Hammill wrote that 1934 film version stripped Anne of the  " Canadian and feminist "  aspects that the Anne of the books possessed, stating that there was something about Anne that Hollywood cannot get right.   Hammill observed that the idea that Anne was entirely cheerful is a product of the film and television versions as the Anne of the books has to deal with loss, rejection, cruel authority figures, and loneliness.
