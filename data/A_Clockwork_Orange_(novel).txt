It is set in a near-future society that has a youth subculture of extreme violence. The teenage protagonist, Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex, narrates his violent exploits and his experiences with state authorities intent on reforming him.     The book is partially written in a Russian language|Russian-influenced argot called  " Nadsat " , which takes its name from the Russian suffix that is equivalent to '-teen' in English.     According to Burgess, it was a ''wikt:jeu d'esprit|jeu d'esprit'' written in just three weeks.    
 
 In 2005, ''A Clockwork Orange'' was included on ''Time (magazine)|Time'' magazine's list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923,     and it was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.  [   " 100 Best Novels " ]. Modern Library. Retrieved 31 October 2012   The original manuscript of the book has been kept at McMaster University's William Ready Division of Archives and Research Collections in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada since the institution purchased the documents in 1971.    
 
 ==Plot summary== 
 
 ===Part 1: Alex's world=== 
 Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex is a 15-year-old living in a near-future dystopian city who leads his gang on a night of opportunistic, random  " ultra-violence " . Alex's friends ( " droogs "  in the novel's Anglo-Russian slang,  " Nadsat " ) are Dim, a slow-witted bruiser, who is the gang's muscle; Georgie, an ambitious second-in-command; and Pete, who mostly plays along as the droogs indulge their taste for ultra-violence. Characterised as a Antisocial personality disorder|sociopath and hardened juvenile delinquent, Alex is also intelligent, quick-witted, and enjoys classical music; he is particularly fond of Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven, whom he calls  " Lovely Ludwig Van " . 
 
 The novella begins with the droogs sitting in their favourite hangout, the Korova Milk Bar, and drinking  " milk-plus "  – a beverage consisting of milk laced with the customer's drug of choice – to prepare for a night of mayhem. They assault a scholar walking home from the public library; rob a store, leaving the owner and his wife bloodied and unconscious; beat up a beggar; then scuffle with a rival gang. Joyride (crime)|Joyriding through the countryside in a stolen car, they break into an isolated cottage and terrorise the young couple living there, beating the husband and gang-rape|gang-raping his wife. In a metafictional touch, the husband is a writer working on a manuscript called  " ''A Clockwork Orange'' " , and Alex contemptuously reads out a paragraph that states the novel's main theme before shredding the manuscript. Back at the Korova, Alex strikes Dim for his crude response to a woman's singing of an operatic passage, and strains within the gang become apparent. At home in his parents' flat, Alex plays classical music at top volume, which he describes as giving him orgasmic bliss before falling asleep. 
 
 Alex feigns illness to his parents to stay out of school the next day. Following an unexpected visit from P.R. Deltoid, his  " post-corrective adviser " , Alex visits a record store, where he meets two pre-teen girls. He invites them back to the flat, where he drugs and rapes them. That night after a nap, Alex finds his droogs in a mutinous mood, waiting downstairs in the torn-up and graffitied lobby. Georgie challenges Alex for leadership of the gang, demanding that they pull a  " man-sized "  job. Alex quells the rebellion by slashing Dim's hand and fighting with Georgie. Then, in a show of generosity, he takes them to a bar, where Alex insists on following through on Georgie's idea to burgle the home of a wealthy elderly woman. Alex breaks in and knocks the woman unconscious; but, when he hears sirens and opens the door to flee, Dim strikes him in payback for the earlier fight. The gang abandons Alex on the front step to be arrested by the police; while in custody, he learns that the woman has died from her injuries. 
 
 ===Part 2: The Ludovico Technique=== 
 Alex is convicted of murder and sentenced to 14 years in Wandsworth Prison. His parents visit one day to inform him that Georgie has been killed in a botched robbery. Two years into his term, he has obtained a job in one of the prison chapels, playing music on the stereo to accompany the Sunday Christian services. The chaplain mistakes Alex's Bible studies for stirrings of faith; in reality, Alex is only reading Scripture for the violent or sexual passages. After his fellow cellmates blame him for beating a troublesome cellmate to death, he is chosen to undergo an experimental behaviour modification treatment called the Ludovico Technique in exchange for having the remainder of his sentence commuted. The technique is a form of aversion therapy, in which Alex is injected with nausea-inducing drugs while watching graphically violent films, eventually conditioning him to become severely ill at the mere thought of violence. As an unintended consequence, the soundtrack to one of the films, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, renders Alex unable to enjoy his beloved classical music as before. 
 
 The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated to a group of VIPs, who watch as Alex collapses before a bully and abases himself before a scantily clad young woman. Although the prison chaplain accuses the state of stripping Alex of free will, the government officials on the scene are pleased with the results and Alex is released from prison. 
 
 ===Part 3: After prison=== 
 Alex returns to his parents' flat, only to find that they are letting his room to a lodger. Now homeless, he wanders the streets and enters a public library, hoping to learn of a painless method for committing suicide. The old scholar whom Alex had assaulted in Part 1 finds him and beats him, with the help of several friends. Two policemen come to Alex's rescue, but they turn out to be Dim and Billyboy, a former rival gang leader. They take Alex outside of town, brutalise him, and abandon him there. Alex collapses at the door of an isolated cottage, realising too late that it is the one he and his droogs invaded in Part 1. 
 
 The writer, F. Alexander, still lives here, but his wife has since died of injuries she sustained in the rape. He does not recognise Alex but gives him shelter and questions him about the conditioning he has undergone. Alexander and his colleagues, all highly critical of the government, plan to use Alex as a symbol of state brutality and thus prevent the incumbent government from being re-elected. Alex inadvertently reveals that he was the ringleader of the home invasion; he is removed from the cottage and locked in an upper-story bedroom as a relentless barrage of classical music plays over speakers. He attempts suicide by leaping from the window. 
 
 Alex wakes up in a hospital, where he is courted by government officials anxious to counter the bad publicity created by his suicide attempt. Placed in a mental institution, Alex is offered a well-paying job if he agrees to side with the government. A round of tests reveals that his old violent impulses have returned, indicating that the hospital doctors have undone the effects of his conditioning. As photographers snap pictures, Alex daydreams of orgiastic violence and reflects,  " I was cured all right. " 
 
 In the final chapter, Alex finds himself halfheartedly preparing for yet another night of crime with a new gang (Lenn, Rick and Bully). After a chance encounter with Pete, who has reformed and married, Alex finds himself taking less and less pleasure in acts of senseless violence. He begins contemplating giving up crime himself to become a productive member of society and start a family of his own, while reflecting on the notion that his own children could possibly end up being just as destructive as he has been, if not more so. 
 
 == Omission of the final chapter ==  
 The book has three parts, each with seven chapters. Burgess has stated that the total of 21 chapters was an intentional nod to the age of 21 being recognised as a milestone in Maturity (psychological)|human maturation.     The 21st chapter was omitted from the editions published in the United States prior to 1986.     In the introduction to the updated American text (these newer editions include the missing 21st chapter), Burgess explains that when he first brought the book to an American publisher, he was told that U.S. audiences would never go for the final chapter, in which Alex sees the error of his ways, decides he has lost his taste for violence and resolves to turn his life around. 
 
 At the American publisher's insistence, Burgess allowed their editors to cut the redeeming final chapter from the U.S. version, so that the tale would end on a darker note, with Alex becoming his old, ultraviolent self again – an ending which the publisher insisted would be  " more realistic "  and appealing to a US audience. The film adaptation, directed by Stanley Kubrick, is based on the American edition of the book (which Burgess considered to be  " badly flawed " ). Kubrick called Chapter 21  " an extra chapter "  and claimed that he had not read the original version until he had virtually finished the screenplay, and that he had never given serious consideration to using it.     In Kubrick's opinion – as in the opinion of other readers, including the original American editor – the final chapter was unconvincing and inconsistent with the book.  
 
 ==Characters== 
 * Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex: The novel's protagonist and leader among his droogs. He often refers to himself as  " Your Humble Narrator " . Having coaxed two ten-year-old girls into his bedroom, Alex refers to himself as  " Alexander the Large "  while raping them; this was later the basis for Alex's claimed surname ''DeLarge'' in the 1971 film. 
 * George, Georgie or Georgie Boy: Effectively Alex's greedy second-in-command. Georgie attempts to undermine Alex's status as leader of the gang and take over their gang as the new leader. He is later killed during a botched robbery while Alex is in prison. 
 * Pete: The only one who does not take particular sides when the droogs fight among themselves. He later meets and marries a girl named Georgina, renouncing his violent ways and even losing his former (Nadsat) speech patterns. A chance encounter with Pete in the final chapter influences Alex to realise that he has grown bored with violence and recognise that human energy is better expended on creation than destruction.  [ A Clockwork Orange Resucked]. The Floating Library. Retrieved on 2013-10-31.  
 * Dim: An idiotic and thoroughly gormless member of the gang, persistently condescended to by Alex, but respected to some extent by his droogs for his formidable fighting abilities, his weapon of choice being a length of bike chain. He later becomes a police officer, exacting his revenge on Alex for the abuse he once suffered under his command. 
 * P. R. Deltoid: A criminal rehabilitation social worker assigned the task of keeping Alex on the straight and narrow. He seemingly has no clue about dealing with young people, and is devoid of empathy or understanding for his troublesome charge. Indeed, when Alex is arrested for murdering an old woman and then ferociously beaten by several police officers, Deltoid simply spits on him. 
 * Prison Chaplain: The character who first questions whether it is moral to turn a violent person into a behavioural automaton who can make no choice in such matters. This is the only character who is truly concerned about Alex's welfare; he is not taken seriously by Alex, though. He is nicknamed by Alex  " prison charlie "  or  " chaplin " , a pun on Charlie Chaplin. 
 * Billyboy: A rival of Alex's. Early on in the story, Alex and his droogs battle Billyboy and his droogs, which ends abruptly when the police arrive. Later, after Alex is released from prison, Billyboy (along with Dim, who like Billyboy has become a police officer) rescues Alex from a mob, then subsequently beats him in a location out of town. 
 * Prison Governor: The man who decides to let Alex  " choose "  to be the first reformed by the Ludovico technique. 
 * The Minister of the Interior: The government high-official who determined that the Ludovico's technique will be used to cut recidivism. He is referred to as ''the Inferior'' by Alex. 
 * Dr Branom: A scientist, co-developer of the Ludovico technique. He appears friendly and almost paternal towards Alex at first, before forcing him into the theatre and what Alex calls the  " chair of torture " . 
 * Dr Brodsky: Branom's colleague and co-developer of the Ludovico technique. He seems much more passive than Branom and says considerably less. 
 * F. Alexander: An author who was in the process of typing his Masterpiece|magnum opus  ''A Clockwork Orange'' when Alex and his droogs broke into his house, beat him, tore up his work and then brutally gang-raped his wife, which caused her subsequent death. He is left deeply scarred by these events and when he encounters Alex two years later, he uses him as a guinea pig in a sadistic experiment intended to prove the Ludovico technique unsound. He is given the name Frank Alexander in the film. 
 * Cat Woman: An indirectly named woman who blocks Alex's gang's entrance scheme, and threatens to shoot Alex and set her cats on him if he does not leave. After Alex breaks into her house, she fights with him, ordering her cats to join the melee, but reprimands Alex for fighting them off. She sustains a fatal blow to the head during the scuffle. She is given the name Miss Weathers in the film. 
 
 ==Analysis== 
 
 ===Background=== 
 ''A Clockwork Orange'' was written in Hove, then a senescent seaside town.     Burgess had arrived back in Britain after his stint abroad to see that much had changed. A youth culture had grown, including coffee bars, pop music and teenage gangs.  A Clockwork Orange (Penguin Modern Classics) (Paperback) by Anthony Burgess, Blake Morrison xv   England was gripped by fears over juvenile delinquency.   Burgess stated that the novel's inspiration was his first wife Lynne's beating by a gang of drunk American servicemen stationed in England during World War II. She subsequently miscarried.   Burgess, A. ''A Clockwork Orange'', Penguin UK, 2011, introduction by Blake Morrison, [ & pg=PT17 & dq=Lynne page 17] :  "  his first wife, Lynne, was beaten, kicked and robbed in London by a gang of four GI deserters  " .   In its investigation of free will, the book's target is ostensibly the concept of behaviourism, pioneered by such figures as B. F. Skinner.  ''A Clockwork Orange'' (Hardback) by Anthony Burgess, Will Self  
 
 Burgess later stated that he wrote the book in three weeks.  
 
 ===Title  === 
 Burgess has offered several clarifications about the meaning and origin of its title: 
 * He had overheard the phrase  " as queer as a clockwork orange "  in a London pub in 1945 and assumed it was a Cockney expression. In ''Clockwork Marmalade'', an essay published in the ''The Listener (magazine)|Listener'' in 1972, he said that he had heard the phrase several times since that occasion. He also explained the title in response to a question from William K. Everson|William Everson on the television programme ''Camera Three'' in 1972,  " Well, the title has a very different meaning but only to a particular generation of London Cockneys. It's a phrase which I heard many years ago and so fell in love with, I wanted to use it, the title of the book. But the phrase itself I did not make up. The phrase  " as queer as a clockwork orange "  is good old East London slang and it didn't seem to me necessary to explain it. Now, obviously, I have to give it an extra meaning. I've implied an extra dimension. I've implied the junction of the organic, the lively, the sweet – in other words, life, the orange – and the mechanical, the cold, the disciplined. I've brought them together in this kind of oxymoron, this sour-sweet word. "  [ ''An examination of Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange''] ''Camera Three'': Creative Arts Television, 2010-08-04. (Video)   [ ''Clockwork Orange: A review with William Everson'']. Retrieved: 2012-03-11.   Nonetheless, no other record of the expression being used before 1962 has ever appeared.     Kingsley Amis notes in his ''Memoirs'' (1991) that no trace of it appears in Eric Partridge's ''Dictionary of Historical Slang''. 
 
 The saying  " as queer as... "  followed by an improbable object:  " ...a clockwork orange " , or  " ...a four-speed walking stick "  or  " ...a left-handed corkscrew "  etc. predates Burgess' novel.     An early example,  " as queer as Dick's hatband " , appeared in 1796,     and was alluded to in 1757.    
 * His second explanation was that it was a pun on the Malay word ''orang'', meaning  " man " . The novella contains no other Malay words or links.  
 * In a prefatory note to ''A Clockwork Orange: A Play with Music'', he wrote that the title was a metaphor for  " an organic entity, full of juice and sweetness and agreeable odour, being turned into a mechanism " .  
 * In his essay ''Clockwork Oranges'', Burgess asserts that  " this title would be appropriate for a story about the application of Ivan Pavlov|Pavlovian or mechanical laws to an organism which, like a fruit, was capable of colour and sweetness " .    
 * While addressing the reader in a letter before some editions of the book, the author says that when a man ceases to have free will, they are no longer a man.  " Just a clockwork orange " , a shiny, appealing object, but  " just a toy to be wound-up by either God or the Devil, or (what is increasingly replacing both) the State. 
 
 This title alludes to the protagonist's negative emotional responses to feelings of evil which prevent the exercise of his free will subsequent to the administration of the Ludovico Technique. To induce this conditioning, Alex is forced to watch scenes of violence on a screen that are Operant conditioning|systematically paired with negative physical stimulation. The negative physical stimulation takes the form of nausea and  " feelings of terror, "  which are caused by an emesis|emetic medicine administered just before the presentation of the films. 
 
 ===Use of slang===  
  
 The book, narrated by Alex, contains many words in a slang argot which Burgess invented for the book, called Nadsat. It is a mix of modified Slavic languages|Slavic words, rhyming slang and derived Russian (like ''baboochka''). For instance, these terms have the following meanings in Nadsat: ''droog'' (друг) = friend; ''moloko'' (молоко) = milk; ''gulliver'' (голова) = head; ''malchick'' (мальчик) or ''malchickiwick'' = boy; ''soomka'' (сумка) = sack or bag; ''Bog'' = God; ''horrorshow'' (хорошо) = good; ''prestoopnick'' (преступник) = criminal; ''rooker'' (рука) = hand; ''cal'' (кал) = crap; ''veck'' ( " человек " ) = man or guy; ''litso'' (лицо) = face; ''malenky'' (маленький) = little; and so on. Some words Burgess invented himself or just adapted from pre-existing languages. Compare Polari. 
 
 One of Alex's doctors explains the language to a colleague as  " odd bits of old rhyming slang; a bit of gypsy talk, too. But most of the roots are Slav propaganda. Subliminal message|Subliminal penetration. "  Some words are not derived from anything, but merely easy to guess, e.g.  " in-out, in-out "  or  " the old in-out "  means sexual intercourse. ''Cutter'', however, means  " money " , because  " cutter "  rhymes with  " bread-and-butter " ; this is rhyming slang, which is intended to be impenetrable to outsiders (especially eavesdropping policemen). Additionally, slang like ''appypolly loggy'' ( " apology " ) seems to derive from school boy slang. This reflects Alex's age of 15. 
 
 In the first edition of the book, no key was provided, and the reader was left to interpret the meaning from the context. In his appendix to the restored edition, Burgess explained that the slang would keep the book from seeming dated, and served to muffle  " the raw response of pornography "  from the acts of violence. 
 
 The term  " ultraviolence " , referring to excessive or unjustified violence, was Neologism|coined by Burgess in the book, which includes the phrase  " do the ultra-violent " . The term's association with Aestheticization of violence|aesthetic violence has led to its use in the media.             
 
 ===Banning and censorship history in the US=== 
 In 1976, ''A Clockwork Orange'' was removed from an Aurora, Colorado high school because of  " objectionable language " . A year later in 1977 it was removed from high school classrooms in Westport, Massachusetts over similar concerns with  " objectionable "  language. In 1982, it was removed from two Anniston, Alabama libraries, later to be reinstated on a restricted basis. Also, in 1973 a bookseller was arrested for selling the novel. The charges were later dropped.     However, each of these instances came after the release of Stanley Kubrick's popular 1971 film adaptation of ''A Clockwork Orange'', itself the subject of much controversy. 
 
 ==Reception== 
 ===Initial response=== 
 ''The Sunday Telegraph'' review was positive, and described the book as  " entertaining ... even profound " .  Chitty, Susan.  " Is That the Lot? "  Sunday Telegraph, 13 May 1962, p. 9.   ''The Sunday Times'' review was negative, and described the book as  " a very ordinary, brutal and psychologically shallow story " .  Brooks, Jeremy.  " A Bedsitter in Dublin. "  Sunday Times, 13 May 1962, p. 32.   ''The Times'' also reviewed the book negatively, describing it as  " a somewhat clumsy experiment with science fiction [with] clumsy cliches about juvenile delinquency " .  " New Fiction. "  Times, 17 May 1962, p. 16.   The violence was criticised as  " unconvincing in detail " .  
 
 ===Writer's appraisal=== 
 File:Burgess1.jpg|right|thumb|Burgess in 1986 
 
 Burgess dismissed ''A Clockwork Orange'' as  " too didactic to be artistic " .  ''A Clockwork Orange'' (Penguin Modern Classics) (Paperback) by Anthony Burgess, Blake Morrison xxii   He claimed that the violent content of the novel  " nauseated "  him.  Calder,, John Mackenzie, and Anthony Burgess,.  " Ugh. "  The Times Literary Supplement, 2 Jan. 1964, p. 9.  
 
 In 1985, Burgess published ''Flame into Being: The Life and Work of D. H. Lawrence'' and while discussing ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' in his biography, Burgess compared that novel's notoriety with ''A Clockwork Orange'':  " We all suffer from the popular desire to make the known notorious. The book I am best known for, or only known for, is a novel I am prepared to repudiate: written a quarter of a century ago, a ''jeu d'esprit'' knocked off for money in three weeks, it became known as the raw material for a film which seemed to glorify sex and violence. The film made it easy for readers of the book to misunderstand what it was about, and the misunderstanding will pursue me until I die. I should not have written the book because of this danger of misinterpretation, and the same may be said of Lawrence and ''Lady Chatterley's Lover''. "  ''Flame into Being: The Life and Work of D. H. Lawrence'' (Heinemann, London 1985) Anthony Burgess, p 205

 ==Adaptations== 
 A 1965 film by Andy Warhol entitled ''Vinyl (1965 film)|Vinyl'' was an adaptation of Burgess's novel.    
 
 The best known adaptation of the novella to other forms is the 1971 film ''A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange'' by Stanley Kubrick, featuring Malcolm McDowell as Alex.     In 1987, Burgess published a stage play titled ''A Clockwork Orange: A Play with Music''. The play includes songs, written by Burgess, which are inspired by Beethoven and Nadsat slang.    
 
 In 1988, a German adaptation of ''A Clockwork Orange'' at the intimate theatre of Bad Godesberg featured a musical score by the German punk rock band Die Toten Hosen which, combined with orchestral clips of Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony and  " other dirty melodies "  (so stated by the subtitle), was released on the album ''Ein kleines bisschen Horrorschau''. The track ''Hier kommt Alex'' became one of the band's signature songs.

 In February 1990, another musical version was produced at the Barbican Theatre in London by the Royal Shakespeare Company. Titled ''A Clockwork Orange: 2004'', it received mostly negative reviews, with John Peter (critic)|John Peter of ''The Sunday Times'' of London calling it  " only an intellectual ''Rocky Horror Show'' " , and John Gross of ''The Sunday Telegraph'' calling it  " a clockwork lemon " . Even Burgess himself, who wrote the script based on his novel, was disappointed. According to ''The Evening Standard'', he called the score, written by Bono and The Edge of the rock group U2 (band)|U2,  " neo-wallpaper. "  Burgess had originally worked alongside the director of the production, Ron Daniels, and envisioned a musical score that was entirely classical. Unhappy with the decision to abandon that score, he heavily criticised the band's experimental mix of hip hop, liturgy|liturgical and gothic music. Lise Hand of ''The Irish Independent'' reported The Edge as saying that Burgess's original conception was  " a score written by a novelist rather than a songwriter " . Calling it  " meaningless glitz " , Jane Edwardes of ''20/20 Magazine'' said that watching this production was  " like being invited to an expensive French Restaurant – and being served with a Big Mac. " 
 
 In 1994, Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater put on a production of ''A Clockwork Orange'' directed by Terry Kinney.  The American premiere of novelist Anthony Burgess's own adaptation of his ''A Clockwork Orange'' starred K. Todd Freeman as Alex. In 2001, UNI Theatre (Mississauga, Ontario) presented the Canadian premiere of the play under the direction of Terry Costa.    
 
 In 2002, Godlight Theatre Company presented the New York Premiere adaptation of ''A Clockwork Orange'' at Manhattan Theatre Source. The production went on to play at the SoHo Playhouse (2002), Ensemble Studio Theatre (2004), 59E59 Theaters (2005) and the Edinburgh Fringe|Edinburgh Festival Fringe (2005). While at Edinburgh, the production received rave reviews from the press while playing to sold-out audiences. The production was directed by Godlight's Artistic Director, Joe Tantalo. 
 
 In 2003, Los Angeles director Brad Mays     and the ARK Theatre Company     staged a multi-media adaptation of ''A Clockwork Orange'',        which was named  " Pick of the Week "  by the ''LA Weekly'' and nominated for three of the 2004 LA Weekly Theater Awards: Direction, Revival Production (of a 20th-century work), and Leading Female Performance.     Vanessa Claire Smith won Best Actress for her gender-bending portrayal of Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex, the music-loving teenage Antisocial personality disorder|sociopath.     This production utilised three separate video streams outputted to seven onstage video monitors – six 19-inch and one 40-inch. In order to preserve the first-person narrative of the book, a pre-recorded video stream of Alex,  " your humble narrator " , was projected onto the 40-inch monitor,     thereby freeing the onstage character during passages which would have been awkward or impossible to sustain in the breaking of the fourth wall.    
 
 An adaptation of the work, based on the original novel, the film and Burgess's own stage version, was performed by The SiLo Theatre in Auckland, New Zealand in early 2007.
