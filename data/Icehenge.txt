 Though published almost ten years before Robinson's Mars trilogy, and taking place in a different version of the future, ''Icehenge'' contains elements that also appear in his Mars series, such as extreme Life extension|human longevity, Martian political revolution, historical revisionism, and shifts between primary characters. 
 
 ==Plot== 
 ''Icehenge'' is set at three distinct time periods, and told from the perspective of three different characters. 
 
 The first narrative is the diary of an engineer caught up in a Martian political revolution in 2248. Effectively kidnapped aboard a mutinous Martian spaceship, she provides assistance to the revolutionaries in their quest for interstellar travel, but ultimately chooses not to travel with them but to return to the doomed revolution on Mars. 
 
 The second narrative is told from the perspective of an archaeology|archaeologist three centuries later. He is involved in a project investigating the failed revolution, and during this finds the engineer's diary buried near the remains of a ruined city. At the same time, a mysterious monument is found at the north pole of Pluto, tying up with a passing mention in the engineer's diary. 
 
 In the final narrative, the great-grandson of the archaeologist visits the monument on Pluto, a scaled-up version of Stonehenge carved in ice. He is investigating the possibility that both the diary and the monument were planted by a reclusive and wealthy businesswoman who lives in the orbit of Saturn. 
 
 ==Development history== 
 The first part of this novel was originally published as the novella ''To Leave a Mark'' in the November 1982 issue of ''The Magazine of Fantasy  &  Science Fiction''.     The third part of ''Icehenge'' was originally published as the novella ''On the North Pole of Pluto'' in 1980 in the anthology Orbit (anthology series)|''Orbit'' 18 edited by Damon Knight.      Robinson gave the novella in rough form to Ursula K. Le Guin to read and edit while he was enrolled in her writing workshop at University of California, San Diego|UCSD in the spring of 1977.     Views of Saturn from the space station visited by the narrator of the novel's third section were inspired by images of Saturn taken during the Voyager program|Voyager flybys in 1980–1981.
