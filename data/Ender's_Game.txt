 == Synopsis == 
  
 In the future, humanity has mastered interplanetary spaceflight and begun to explore the galaxy. In doing so they encounter an alien race called the Formics, commonly referred to in the series as the  " buggers " . The discovery of a bugger base in the asteroid 433 Eros|Eros leads to war between the species that the humans narrowly win, resulting in the discovery of advanced alien technology, including gravity manipulation. Ostensibly in preparation for another bugger invasion, an International Fleet (I.F.) is established on Earth, which creates a Battle School in Earth's orbit to develop gifted children into commanders capable of defeating the buggers in the next war. 
 
 Protagonist Andrew  " Ender "  Wiggin is born a  " Third " : a rare exception to Earth's two-child policy, allowed by the government due to the promise shown by his two older siblings. The eldest, Peter Wiggin|Peter, is a highly intelligent antisocial personality disorder|sociopath who sadistically bullies Ender. His sister, Valentine Wiggin|Valentine, is more sympathetic towards him. The I.F. remove Ender's monitoring device when he is six years old, seemingly ending his chances of Battle School, and he gets teased by a fellow student, Stilson. Knowing that Ender is no longer monitored Stilson attackes him, but Ender instead viciously beats Stilson, beyond what was expected of a school yard fight.  Unknown to Ender, Stilson dies from his injuries. When explaining his actions to I.F. Colonel Hyrum Graff, Ender states his belief that, by showing superiority now, he has prevented future struggle. Graff, on hearing of this, offers Ender a place in the Battle School. 
 
 Graff and the other leaders of the school covertly work to isolate Ender from his fellow recruits and prevent him from growing too comfortable in his environment. The cadets participate in competitive war simulations in zero gravity, where Ender quickly masters the game and dominates his opponents. The school continually tries to break Ender down, first promoting him to command a new army composed of raw recruits, then pitting him against multiple armies at once, but Ender's success continues. Ender's jealous ex-commander, Bonzo Madrid, draws him into a fight outside the simulation, and once again seeking to pre-emptively stop future conflicts Ender uses excessive force, and like Stilson before him Bonzo dies from his injuries. 
 
 On Earth, Peter Wiggin uses a global communication system to post political essays under the pseudonym  " John Locke|Locke " , hoping to establish himself as a respected orator and then as a powerful politician. Valentine, despite not trusting Peter, agrees to publish alongside him as  " Demosthenes " . Their essays are soon taken seriously by the government. Though Graff is told their true identities, he recommends that it be kept a secret, because their writings are politically useful. 
 
 Ender, now 10 years old, is promoted to Command School on Eros after a brief respite on Earth. After some preliminary battles in the simulator, he is introduced to a former war hero, Mazer Rackham. From then on, Ender participates in simulations created and controlled by Mazer. As the skirmishes become harder, he is joined by some of his friends from the Battle School as sub-commanders. Despite this, Ender becomes depressed by the battles, his isolation, and by the way Mazer treats him. 
 
 When told that he is facing his final test, Ender finds his fleet far outnumbered by the buggers surrounding their queens' homeworld. Hoping to earn himself expulsion from the school for his ruthlessness, he sacrifices his entire fleet to fire a Molecular Disruption Device at the buggers' homeworld. The Device destroys the planet and the surrounding bugger fleet. Mazer informs Ender that the  " simulations "  he has been fighting were real battles, directing human spacecraft against bugger fleets via an ansible, and that Ender has won the war. Ender becomes more depressed on learning this, realizing that he has committed genocide. 
 
 When he recovers, he learns that, at the end of the bugger war, Earth's powers fought among themselves. He stays on Eros as his friends return home and colonists venture to other worlds, using Eros as a way station. Among the first colonists is Valentine, who apologizes for the fact that Ender can never return to Earth, where he would be exploited by Peter and other politicians to fulfill their own purposes. Instead, Ender joins the colony program to populate one of the buggers' former worlds. There, he discovers the dormant egg of a bugger queen, who reveals that the buggers had initially assumed humans were a non-sentient race, for want of collective consciousness, but realized their mistake too late, and requests that Ender take the egg to a new planet to colonize. 
 
 Ender takes the egg and, with information from the Queen, writes ''The Hive Queen (Ender's Game)|The Hive Queen'' under the alias  " Speaker for the Dead " . Peter, now the leader of Earth and age 77 with a failing heart, recognizes Ender as the author of ''The Hive Queen''. He asks Ender to write a book about him, which Ender titles ''Hegemon|The Hegemon''. The combined works create a new type of funeral, in which the Speaker for the Dead tells the whole and unapologetic story of the deceased, adopted by many on Earth and its colonies. In the end, Ender and Valentine board a series of near-lightspeed starships and Interstellar travel|visit many worlds, looking for a safe place to establish the unborn Hive Queen. 
 
 == Creation and inspiration == 
 The original  " Ender's Game (short story)|Ender's Game "  is a short story that provides a small snapshot of Ender's experiences in Battle School and Command School; the full-length novel encompasses more of Ender's life before, during, and after the war, and also contains some chapters describing the political exploits of his older siblings back on Earth. In a commentary track for the 20th anniversary audiobook edition of the novel, as well as in the 1991 Author's Definitive Edition, Card stated that ''Ender's Game'' was written specifically to establish the Character (arts)|character of Ender for his role of the Speaker in ''Speaker for the Dead'', the outline for which he had written before novelizing ''Ender's Game''.     In his 1991 introduction to the novel, Card discussed the influence of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series on the novelette and novel. Historian Bruce Catton's work on the American Civil War also influenced Card.  
 
 ''Ender's Game'' was the first science-fiction novel published entirely online, when it appeared on Delphi (online service)|Delphi a year before print publication.    
 
 == Critical response == 
 ''Ender's Game'' won the Nebula Award for best novel in 1985,     and the Hugo Award for best novel in 1986,     considered the two most prestigious awards in science fiction.         ''Ender's Game'' was also nominated for a Locus Award in 1986.   In 1999, it placed No. & nbsp;59 on the reader's list of Modern Library 100 Best Novels. It was also honored with a spot on American Library Association's  " 100 Best Books for Teens " .  In 2008, the novel, along with ''Ender's Shadow'', won the Margaret A. Edwards Award, which honors an author and specific works by that author for lifetime contribution to young adult literature.     ''Ender's Game'' was included in Damien Broderick's book ''Science Fiction: The 101 Best Novels 1985–2010''.     It ranked number nine on Locus's top SF novels published before 1990.    
 
 ''The New York Times'' writer Gerald Jonas asserts that the novel's plot summary resembles a  " grade Z, made-for-television, science-fiction rip-off movie " , but says that Card develops the elements well despite this  " unpromising material " . Jonas further praises the development of the character Ender Wiggin:  " Alternately likable and insufferable, he is a convincing little Napoleon in short pants. "    
 
 The novel has received criticism for violence and its justification. Elaine Radford's review,  " Ender and Hitler: Sympathy for the Superman " , posits that Ender Wiggin is an intentional reference by Card to Adolf Hitler and criticizes the violence in the novel, particularly at the hands of the protagonist.     Card responded to Radford's criticisms in ''Fantasy Review'', the same publication. Radford's criticisms are echoed in John Kessel's essay  " Creating the Innocent Killer: Ender's Game, Intention, and Morality " , wherein Kessel states:  " Ender gets to strike out at his enemies and still remain morally clean. ''Nothing'' is his fault. "     Noah Berlatsky makes similar claims in his analysis of the relationship between colonization and science fiction, where he describes ''Ender's Game'' as in part a justification of  " Western expansion and genocide " .    
 
 The U.S. Marine Corps Professional Reading List makes the novel recommended reading at several lower ranks, and again at Officer Candidate/Midshipman.   
  
 The book was placed on the reading list by Captain John F. Schmitt, author of FMFM-1 (Fleet Marine Fighting Manual, on maneuver doctrine) for  " provid[ing] useful allegories to explain why militaries do what they do in a particularly effective shorthand way " .    
 In introducing the novel for use in leadership training, Marine Corps University's Lejeune program opines that it offers  " lessons in training methodology, leadership, and ethics as well. . . . ''Ender's Game'' has been a stalwart item on the Marine Corps Reading List since its inception " .   It is also used as an early fictional example of Educational game|game-based learning.
