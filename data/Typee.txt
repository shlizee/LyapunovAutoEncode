 ''Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life'' is the first book by American writer Herman Melville, published first in London, then New York, in 1846. Considered a classic in Travel literature|travel and adventure literature, the narrative is partly based on the author's actual experiences on the island Nuku Hiva in the South Pacific Marquesas Islands in 1842, liberally supplemented with imaginative reconstruction and adaptation of material from other books. The title comes from the valley of Tai Pī (province)|Taipivai, once known as Taipi.  Christian, F.W., Nuku and Uia-Ei, 1895,  " Notes on the Marquesans, "  Journal of the Polynesian Society 4(3):187-202. Page 200   ''Typee'' was Melville's most popular work during his lifetime; it made him notorious as the  " man who lived among the cannibals " .

 The book presents itself as a piece of travel adventure, but from the beginning there were questions whether the story was true. The London edition of the book appeared in the publisher John Murray's ''Colonial and Home Library'' series, accounts of foreigners in exotic places, and the slightly suspicious Murray required reassurance that Melville's experiences was first-hand, not the work of a professional travel writer, and that the author had himself experienced the adventures he described. American readers, however, accepted the story at face value. 
 
 ''Typee'' is,  " in fact, neither literal autobiography nor pure fiction, "  says scholar Leon Howard. Melville  " drew his material from his experiences, from his imagination, and from a variety of travel books when the memory of his experiences were inadequate. "  He departed from what actually happened in several ways, sometimes by extending factual incidents, sometimes by fabricating them, and sometimes by what one scholar calls  " outright lies " . 
 
 The actual one-month stay on which ''Typee'' is based is presented as four months in the narrative; there is no lake on the actual island on which Melville might have canoed with the lovely Fayaway, and the ridge which Melville describes climbing after escaping the ship he may actually have seen in an engraving. He drew extensively on contemporary accounts by Pacific explorers to add to what might otherwise have been a straightforward story of escape, capture, and re-escape. Most American reviewers accepted the story as authentic, though it provoked disbelief among some British readers.  
 
 Two years after the novel's publication, many of the events described therein were corroborated by Melville's fellow castaway, Richard Tobias  " Toby "  Greene.

 ''Typee''s narrative expresses sympathy for the so-called savage natives, while criticizing the missionaries' attempts to civilize them: 
 
  
 It may be asserted without fear of contradictions that in all the cases of 
 outrages committed by Polynesians, Europeans have at some time or 
 other been the aggressors, and that the cruel and bloodthirsty 
 disposition of some of the islanders is mainly to be ascribed to 
 the influence of such examples. 
 
 [The] voluptuous Indian, with every desire supplied, 
 whom Providence has bountifully provided with all the sources of 
 pure and natural enjoyment, and from whom are removed so many of 
 the ills and pains of life—what has he to desire at the hands of 
 Civilization?  Will he be the happier?  Let the once smiling and 
 populous Hawaiian islands, with their now diseased, starving, and 
 dying natives, answer the question. The missionaries may seek to 
 disguise the matter as they will, but the facts are incontrovertible. 
  
  
 
 The narrator states that Typee natives ate an inhabitant of one of the neighboring valleys, but the natives who captured him reassured him that he would not be eaten. 
 
 ''The Knickerbocker'' called ''Typee''  " a piece of Baron Munchausen|Münchhausenism " .  Miller (1956), 203.   New York publisher Evert Augustus Duyckinck wrote to Nathaniel Hawthorne that  " it is a lively and pleasant book, not over philosophical perhaps. "  Widmer (1999), 108    In 1939 Charles Robert Anderson published ''Melville in the South Seas''   Charles Roberts Anderson. ''Melville in the South Seas.'' (New York: Columbia University Press ''Columbia University Studies in English and Comparative Literature'', No. 138,  1939).   
 in which he documented that Melville had spent only one month on the island (rather than the four months he claimed) and that Melville lifted extensive material from travel narratives.  Koy (2017), 35.  
 
 ==Publication history== 
 ''Typee'' was published first in London by John Murray (publishing house)|John Murray on February 26, 1846, and then in New York by G. P. Putnam's Sons|Wiley and Putnam on March 17, 1846. It was Melville's first book, and made him one of the best-known American authors overnight.  Miller (1956), 4  
 
 The same version was published in London and New York in the first edition; however, Melville removed critical references to missionaries and Christianity from the second U.S. edition at the request of his American publisher. Later additions included a  " Sequel: The Story of Toby "  written by Melville, explaining what happened to Toby.    
 
 Before ''Typee''s publication in New York, Wiley and Putnam asked Melville to remove one sentence. In a scene where the ''Dolly'' is boarded by young women from Nukuheva, Melville originally wrote: 
  Our ship was now given up to every species of riot and debauchery. Not the feeblest barrier was interposed between the unholy passions of the crew and their unlimited gratification.  
 The second sentence was removed from the final version.  Nelson (1981), 187  
 
 The inaugural book of the Library of America series, titled ''Typee, Omoo, Mardi'' (May 6, 1982), was a volume containing ''Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life'', its sequel ''Omoo|Omoo: A Narrative of Adventures in the South Seas'' (1847), and ''Mardi|Mardi, and a Voyage Thither'' (1849).
