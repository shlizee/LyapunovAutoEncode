 
 ''The Computer Contradictionary'' is a non-fiction book by Stan Kelly-Bootle that compiles a satirical list of definitions of computer industry terms.  It is an example of  " cynical lexicography "  in the tradition of Ambrose Bierce's ''The Devil's Dictionary''.      Rather than offering a factual account of usage, its definitions are largely made up by the author.    
 
 The book was published in May 1995 by MIT Press and is an update of Kelly-Bootle's ''The Devil's data processing|DP Dictionary'' which appeared in 1981.

 ==Reception==
