 The  (Latin for  " British Encyclopaedia " ) is a general knowledge English-language online encyclopaedia. It was formerly published by Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., and other publishers (for previous editions). It was written by about 100 & nbsp;full-time editors and more than 4,000 & nbsp;contributors. The 2010 version of the 15th edition, which spans 32 volumes   and 32,640 pages, was the last printed edition. 
 
 The ''Britannica'' is the English-language encyclopaedia that was in print for the longest time: it lasted 244 years. It was first published between 1768 and 1771 in the Scottish capital of Edinburgh, as three volumes. (This first edition is available in facsimile.) The encyclopaedia grew in size: the second edition was 10 volumes,     and by its fourth edition (1801–1810) it had expanded to 20 volumes.     Its rising stature as a scholarly work helped recruit eminent contributors, and the 9th (1875–1889) and Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|11th editions (1911) are landmark encyclopaedias for scholarship and literary style. Starting with the 11th edition and following its acquisition by an American firm, the ''Britannica'' shortened and simplified articles to broaden its appeal to the North American market. In 1933, the ''Britannica'' became the first encyclopaedia to adopt  " continuous revision " , in which the encyclopaedia is continually reprinted, with every article updated on a schedule. In March 2012, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. announced it would no longer publish printed editions, and would focus instead on the online version.    
 
 The 15th edition had a three-part structure: a 12-volume  of short articles (generally fewer than 750 & nbsp;words), a 17-volume  of long articles (two to 310 & nbsp;pages), and a single  volume to give a hierarchical outline of knowledge. The  was meant for quick fact-checking and as a guide to the ; readers are advised to study the  outline to understand a subject's context and to find more detailed articles. Over 70 years, the size of the ''Britannica'' has remained steady, with about 40 & nbsp;million words on half a million topics. Though published in the United States since 1901, the ''Britannica'' has for the most part maintained American and British English spelling differences|British English spelling.

 File:Encyclopaedia Britannica 15 with 2002.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|15th edition of the ''Britannica''. The initial volume with the green spine is the ; the red-spined and black-spined volumes are the  and the , respectively. The last three volumes are the 2002 Book of the Year (black spine) and the two-volume index (cyan spine). 
 Since 1985, the ''Britannica'' has had four parts: the , the , the , and a two-volume index. The ''Britannica'' articles are found in the  and , which encompass 12 and 17 volumes, respectively, each volume having roughly one thousand pages. The 2007  has 699 in-depth articles, ranging in length from 2 to 310 pages and having references and named contributors. In contrast, the 2007  has roughly 65,000 articles, the vast majority (about 97%) of which contain fewer than 750 words, no references, and no named contributors.   The  articles are intended for quick fact-checking and to help in finding more thorough information in the . The  articles are meant both as authoritative, well-written articles on their subjects and as storehouses of information not covered elsewhere.   The longest article (310 pages) is on the United States, and resulted from the merger of the articles on the individual states. A 2013  " Global Edition "  of ''Britannica'' contained approximately forty thousand articles.    
 
 Information can be found in the ''Britannica'' by following the cross-references in the  and ; however, these are sparse, averaging one cross-reference per page.   Hence, readers are recommended to consult instead the alphabetical index or the , which organizes the ''Britannica'' contents by topic.    
 
 The core of the  is its  " Outline of Knowledge " , which aims to provide a logical framework for all human knowledge.   Accordingly, the Outline is consulted by the ''Britannica'' editors to decide which articles should be included in the  and .   The Outline is also intended to be a study guide, to put subjects in their proper perspective, and to suggest a series of ''Britannica'' articles for the student wishing to learn a topic in depth.   However, libraries have found that it is scarcely used, and reviewers have recommended that it be dropped from the encyclopaedia.     The  also has color transparencies of human anatomy and several appendices listing the staff members, advisors, and contributors to all three parts of the ''Britannica''. 
 
 Taken together, the  and  comprise roughly 40 million words and 24,000 images.   The two-volume index has 2,350 pages, listing the 228,274 topics covered in the ''Britannica'', together with 474,675 subentries under those topics.   The ''Britannica'' generally prefers British English|British spelling over American English|American;   for example, it uses ''colour'' (not ''color''), ''centre'' (not ''center''), and ''encyclopaedia'' (not ''encyclopedia''). However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as ''defense'' rather than ''defence''.     Common alternative spellings are provided with cross-references such as  " Color: ''see'' Colour. " 
 
 Since 1936, the articles of the ''Britannica'' have been revised on a regular schedule, with at least 10% of them considered for revision each year.    According to one Britannica website, 46% of its articles were revised over the past three years;     however, according to another Britannica website, only 35% of the articles were revised.    
 
 The alphabetization of articles in the  and  follows strict rules.   preface| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}   Diacritical marks and non-English letters are ignored, while numerical entries such as  " War of 1812|1812, War of "  are alphabetized as if the number had been written out ( " Eighteen-twelve, War of " ). Articles with identical names are ordered first by persons, then by places, then by things. Rulers with identical names are organized first alphabetically by country and then by chronology; thus, Charles the Simple|Charles III of France precedes Charles I of England, listed in ''Britannica'' as the ruler of Great Britain and Ireland. (That is, they are alphabetized as if their titles were  " Charles, France, 3 "  and  " Charles, Great Britain and Ireland, 1 " .) Similarly, places that share names are organized alphabetically by country, then by ever-smaller political divisions. 
 
 In March 2012, the company announced that the 2010 edition would be the last printed version. This was announced as a move by the company to adapt to the times and focus on its future using digital distribution.     The peak year for the printed encyclopaedia was 1990 when 120,000 sets were sold, but it dropped to 40,000 in 1996.     12,000 sets of the 2010 edition were printed, of which 8,000 had been sold .     By late April 2012, the remaining copies of the 2010 edition had sold out at Britannica's online store. , a replica of Britannica's 1768 first edition is sold on the online store.

Anita Wolff was listed as the Deputy Editor and Theodore Pappas as Executive Editor.   Prior Executive Editors include John V. Dodge (1950–1964) and Philip W. Goetz. 
 
 Paul T. Armstrong remains the longest working employee of Encyclopædia Britannica. He began his career there in 1934, eventually earning the positions of treasurer, vice president, and chief financial officer in his 58 years with the company, before retiring in 1992.

The editorial staff helped to write the articles of the  and some sections of the .     The preparation and publication of the  required trained staff. According to the final page of the 2007 , the staff were organized into ten departments:  |bibcode=1991neb..book.....G |last1=Goetz |first1=Philip W. }}

 # Information Management (9 employees) 
 # Media Asset Management and Production Control (4 employees) 
 # Reference Librarians (3 employees) 
 # World Data (5 employees) 
 # Manufacturing (1 employee) 
 
 Some of these departments were organized hierarchy|hierarchically. For example, the copy editors were divided into four copy editors, two senior copy editors, four supervisors, plus a coordinator and a director. Similarly, the Editorial department was headed by Dale Hoiberg and assisted by four others; they oversaw the work of five senior editors, nine associate editors, and one executive assistant. 
 
 Britannica had 14 editors in 2019: Adam Augustyn, Patricia Bauer, Brian Duignan, Alison Eldridge, Erik Gregersen, Amy McKenna, Melissa Petruzzello, John P. Rafferty, Michael Ray, Kara Rogers, Amy Tikkanen, Jeff Wallenfeldt, Adam Zeidan, and Alicja Zelazko.    
 
 === Editorial advisors === 
 The ''Britannica'' has an editorial board of advisors, which includes 12 distinguished scholars:  | page = 5| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}      non-fiction author Nicholas G. Carr|Nicholas Carr, religion scholar Wendy Doniger, political economist Benjamin M. Friedman, Council on Foreign Relations President Emeritus Leslie H.

Adler.  | pages = 524–530| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}   Roughly half of these advisors have since died, including some of the Outline's chief architects – Rene Dubos (d. 1982), Loren Eiseley (d. 1977), Harold D. Lasswell (d. 1978), Mark Van Doren (d. 1972), Peter Ritchie Calder (d. 1982) and Mortimer J. Adler (d. 2001).

 === Corporate structure === 
 In January 1996, the ''Britannica'' was purchased from the Benton Foundation by billionaire Swiss financier Jacqui Safra,     who serves as its current Chair of the Board. In 1997, Don Yannias, a long-time associate and investment advisor of Safra, became CEO of Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.     In 1999, a new company, Britannica.com Inc., was corporate spin-off|created to develop digital versions of the ''Britannica''; Yannias assumed the role of CEO in the new company, while his former position at the parent company remained vacant for two years. Yannias' tenure at Britannica.com Inc. was marked by missteps, considerable lay-offs, and financial losses.     In 2001, Yannias was replaced by Ilan Yeshua, who reunited the leadership of the two companies.     Yannias later returned to investment management, but remains on the ''Britannica'' Board of Directors. 
 
 In 2003, former management consultant Jorge Aguilar-Cauz was appointed President of Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. Cauz is the senior executive and reports directly to the ''Britannica's'' Board of Directors. Cauz has been pursuing alliances with other companies and extending the ''Britannica'' brand to new educational and reference products, continuing the strategy pioneered by former CEO Elkan Harrison Powell in the mid-1930s.  | page = 2| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}  
 
 Under Safra's ownership, the company has experienced financial difficulties and has responded by reducing the price of its products and implementing drastic cost cuts. According to a 2003 report in the ''New York Post'', the ''Britannica'' management has eliminated employee 401(k) accounts and encouraged the use of free images. These changes have had negative impacts, as freelance contributors have waited up to six months for checks and the ''Britannica'' staff have gone years without pay rises.     
 
 In the fall of 2017, Karthik Krishnan was appointed global chief executive officer of the Encyclopædia Britannica Group. Krishnan brought a varied perspective to the role based on several high-level positions in digital media, including RELX (Reed Elsevier, FT SE 100) and Rodale, in which he was responsible for  " driving business and cultural transformation and accelerating growth " .    
 
 Taking the reins of the company as it was preparing to mark its 250th anniversary and define the next phase of its digital strategy for consumers and K-12 schools, Krishnan launched a series of new initiatives in his first year. 
 
 First was Britannica Insights,     a free, downloadable software extension to the Google Chrome browser that served up edited, fact-checked Britannica information with queries on search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing. Its purpose, the company said, was to  " provide trusted, verified information "  in conjunction with search results that were thought to be increasingly unreliable in the era of misinformation and  " fake news. " 
 
 The product was quickly followed by Britannica School Insights, which provided similar content for subscribers to Britannica's online classroom solutions, and a partnership with YouTube     in which verified Britannica content appeared on the site as an antidote to user-generated video content that could be false or misleading.  & nbsp; 
 
 Krishnan, himself an educator at New York University's New York University Stern School of Business|Stern School of Business, believes in the  " transformative power of education "     and set steering the company toward solidifying its place among leaders in educational technology and supplemental curriculum. Krishnan aimed at providing more useful and relevant solutions to customer needs, extending and renewing Britannica's historical emphasis on  " Utility " ,   Asia Outlook Magazine|website=Asia Outlook Magazine|language=en-GB|access-date=3 December 2018}}   which had been the watchword of its first edition in 1768. 
 
 Krishnan also is active in civic affairs, with organizations such as the Urban Enterprise Initiative and Urban Upbound, whose board he serves on. 
 
 == Competition == 
 As the ''Britannica'' is a general encyclopaedia, it does not seek to compete with specialized encyclopaedias such as the ''Encyclopaedia of Mathematics'' or the ''Dictionary of the Middle Ages'', which can devote much more space to their chosen topics. In its first years, the ''Britannica'' main competitor was the general encyclopaedia of Ephraim Chambers and, soon thereafter, ''Rees's Cyclopædia'' and Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge's ''Encyclopædia Metropolitana''. In the 20th century, successful competitors included ''Collier's Encyclopedia'', the ''Encyclopedia Americana'', and the ''World Book Encyclopedia''. Nevertheless, from the 9th edition onwards, the ''Britannica'' was widely considered to have the greatest authority of any general English-language encyclopaedia,   especially because of its broad coverage and eminent authors.    The print version of the ''Britannica'' was significantly more expensive than its competitors.   
 
 Since the early 1990s, the ''Britannica'' has faced new challenges from digital information sources. The Internet, facilitated by the development of Web search engine|search engines, has grown into a common source of information for many people, and provides easy access to reliable original sources and expert opinions, thanks in part to initiatives such as Google Book Search|Google Books, Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT's MIT OpenCourseWare|release of its educational materials and the open PubMed Central library of the National Library of Medicine.        In general, the Internet tends to provide more current coverage than print media, due to the ease with which material on the Internet can be updated.     In rapidly changing fields such as science, technology, politics, culture and modern history, the ''Britannica'' has struggled to stay up to date, a problem first analysed systematically by its former editor Walter Yust.   Eventually, the ''Britannica'' turned to focus more on its online edition.    
 
 === Print encyclopaedias === 
 The  has been compared with other print encyclopaedias, both qualitatively and quantitatively.     A well-known comparison is that of Kenneth Kister, who gave a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the ''Britannica'' with two comparable encyclopaedias, ''Collier's Encyclopedia'' and the ''Encyclopedia Americana''.   For the quantitative analysis, ten articles were selected at random—circumcision, Charles R. Drew|Charles Drew, Galileo, Philip Glass, heart disease, IQ, panda bear, sexual harassment, Shroud of Turin and Uzbekistan—and letter grades of A–D or F were awarded in four categories: coverage, accuracy, clarity, and recency. In all four categories and for all three encyclopaedias, the four average grades fell between grade conversion|B− and B+, chiefly because none of the encyclopaedias had an article on sexual harassment in 1994. In the accuracy category, the ''Britannica'' received one  " D "  and seven  " A " s, ''Encyclopedia Americana'' received eight  " A " s, and ''Collier's'' received one  " D "  and seven  " A " s; thus, ''Britannica'' received an average score of 92% for accuracy to ''Americana''s 95% and ''Collier's'' 92%. In the timeliness category, ''Britannica'' averaged an 86% to ''Americanas 90% and ''Collier's'' 85%. 
 
 In 2013, the President of Encyclopædia Britannica announced that after 244 years, the encyclopedia would cease print production and all future editions would be entirely digital.    
 
 === Digital encyclopaedias on optical media === 
 The most notable competitor of the ''Britannica'' among CD/DVD-ROM digital encyclopaedias was ''Encarta'',   now discontinued, a modern, multimedia encyclopaedia that incorporated three print encyclopaedias: ''Funk  &  Wagnalls'', ''Collier's Encyclopedia|Collier's'' and the ''New Merit Scholar's Encyclopedia''. ''Encarta'' was the top-selling multimedia encyclopaedia, based on total US retail sales from January 2000 to February 2006.   Sales figures for January 2000 & nbsp;– February 2006 as provided by the NPD Group.   Both occupied the same price range, with the ''Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite|2007 Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate'' CD or DVD costing US$40–50        and the Microsoft Encarta Premium 2007 DVD costing US$45.     The ''Britannica'' contains 100,000 articles and ''Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster's Dictionary and Thesaurus'' (US only), and offers Primary and Secondary School editions.   ''Encarta'' contained 66,000 articles, a user-friendly Visual Browser, interactive maps, math, language and homework tools, a US and UK dictionary, and a youth edition.   Like ''Encarta'', the ''Britannica'' has been criticized for being biased towards United States audiences; the United Kingdom-related articles are updated less often, maps of the United States are more detailed than those of other countries, and it lacks a UK dictionary.     Like the ''Britannica'', ''Encarta'' was available online by subscription, although some content could be accessed free.    
 
 === Internet encyclopaedias === 
 The dominant internet encyclopaedia and main alternative to ''Britannica'' is Wikipedia.           The key differences between the two lie in accessibility; the model of participation they bring to an Encyclopédistes|encyclopedic project; their respective style sheets and editorial policies; relative ages; the number of subjects treated; the number of languages in which articles are written and made available; and their underlying economic models: unlike ''Britannica'', Wikipedia is a not-for-profit and is not connected with traditional profit- and contract-based publishing distribution networks. 
 
 The 699 printed  articles are generally written by identified contributors, and the roughly 65,000 printed  articles are the work of the editorial staff and identified outside consultants. Thus, a ''Britannica'' article either has known authorship   or a set of possible authors (the editorial staff). With the exception of the editorial staff, most of the ''Britannica'' contributors are experts in their field—some are Nobel laureates.   By contrast, the articles of Wikipedia are written by people of unknown degrees of expertise: most do not claim any particular expertise, and of those who do, many are anonymous and have no verifiable credentials.   It is for this lack of institutional vetting, or certification, that former ''Britannica'' editor-in-chief Robert McHenry notes his belief that Wikipedia cannot hope to rival the ''Britannica'' in accuracy.    
 
 In 2005, the journal ''Nature'' chose articles from both websites in a wide range of science topics and sent them to what it called  " relevant "  field experts for peer review. The experts then compared the competing articles—one from each site on a given topic—side by side, but were not told which article came from which site. ''Nature'' got back 42 usable reviews. 
 
 In the end, the journal found just eight serious errors, such as general misunderstandings of vital concepts: four from each site. It also discovered many factual errors, omissions or misleading statements: 162 in Wikipedia and 123 in ''Britannica'', an average of 3.86 mistakes per article for Wikipedia and 2.92 for ''Britannica''.        Although ''Britannica ''was revealed as the more accurate encyclopedia, with fewer errors, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. in its detailed 20-page rebuttal called ''Natures study flawed and misleading     and called for a  " prompt "  retraction. It noted that two of the articles in the study were taken from a ''Britannica'' yearbook and not the encyclopaedia, and another two were from ''Compton's Encyclopedia'' (called the ''Britannica Student Encyclopedia'' on the company's website). The rebuttal went on to mention that some of the articles presented to reviewers were combinations of several articles, and that other articles were merely excerpts but were penalized for factual omissions. The company also noted that several of what ''Nature'' called errors were minor spelling variations, and that others were matters of interpretation. ''Nature'' defended its story and declined to retract, stating that, as it was comparing Wikipedia with the web version of ''Britannica'', it used whatever relevant material was available on ''Britannica''s website.    
 
 Interviewed in February 2009, the managing director of ''Britannica UK'' said: . My job is to create more awareness of our very different approaches to publishing in the public mind. They're a chisel, we're a drill, and you need to have the correct tool for the job.  }}

 Since the 3rd edition, the ''Britannica'' has enjoyed a popular and critical reputation for general excellence.         The 3rd and the 9th editions were pirated for sale in the United States,   beginning with ''Dobson's Encyclopaedia''.     On the release of the 14th edition, ''Time (magazine)|Time'' magazine dubbed the ''Britannica'' the  " Patriarch of the Library " .     In a related advertisement, naturalist William Beebe was quoted as saying that the ''Britannica'' was  " beyond comparison because there is no competitor. "     References to the ''Britannica'' can be found throughout English literature, most notably in one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's favourite Sherlock Holmes stories,  " The Red-Headed League " . The tale was highlighted by the Lord Mayor of London, Gilbert Inglefield, at the Bicentennial of the Encyclopædia Britannica|bicentennial of the ''Britannica''.  
 
 The ''Britannica'' has a reputation for summarising knowledge.     To further their education, some people have devoted themselves to reading the entire ''Britannica'', taking anywhere from three to 22 years to do so.   When Fat'h Ali Shah Qajar|Fat'h Ali became the Qajar dynasty|Shah of Persia in 1797, he was given a set of the ''Britannica's'' 3rd edition, which he read completely; after this feat, he extended his royal title to include  " Most Formidable Lord and Master of the  " .     Writer George Bernard Shaw claimed to have read the complete 9th edition—except for the science articles  —and Richard Evelyn Byrd took the ''Britannica'' as reading material for his five-month stay at the South Pole in 1934, while Philip Beaver read it during a sailing expedition. More recently, A.J. Jacobs, an editor at ''Esquire (magazine)|Esquire'' magazine, read the entire 2002 version of the 15th edition, describing his experiences in the well-received 2004 book, ''The Know-It-All: One Man's Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World''. Only two people are known to have read two independent editions: the author C. S. Forester   and Amos Urban Shirk, an American businessman who read the 11th and 14th editions, devoting roughly three hours per night for four and a half years to read the 11th.     Several editors-in-chief of the ''Britannica'' are likely to have read their editions completely, such as William Smellie (encyclopedist)|William Smellie (1st edition), William Robertson Smith (9th edition), and Walter Yust (14th edition). 
 
 === Awards === 
 The CD/DVD-ROM version of the ''Britannica'', ''Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite'', received the 2004 Distinguished Achievement Award from the Association of Educational Publishers.     On 15 July 2009,  was awarded a spot as one of  " Top Ten Superbrands in the UK "  by a panel of more than 2,000 independent reviewers, as reported by the BBC.    
 
 === Coverage of topics === 
 Topics are chosen in part by reference to the   " Outline of Knowledge " .   The bulk of the ''Britannica'' is devoted to geography (26% of the ), biography (14%), biology and medicine (11%), literature (7%), physics and astronomy (6%), religion (5%), art (4%), Western philosophy (4%), and law (3%).   A complementary study of the  found that geography accounted for 25% of articles, science 18%, social sciences 17%, biography 17%, and all other humanities 25%.   Writing in 1992, one reviewer judged that the  " range, depth, and wikt:catholicity|catholicity of coverage [of the ''Britannica''] are unsurpassed by any other general Encyclopaedia. "    
 
 The ''Britannica'' does not cover topics in equivalent detail; for example, the whole of Buddhism and most other religions is covered in a single  article, whereas 14 articles are devoted to Christianity, comprising nearly half of all religion articles.  | bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}   However, the ''Britannica'' has been lauded as the ''least'' biased of general Encyclopaedias marketed to Western readers   and praised for its biographies of important women of all eras.  
 
  
 
 === Criticism of editorial decisions === 
 On rare occasions, the ''Britannica'' has been criticized for its editorial choices. Given its roughly constant size, the encyclopaedia has needed to reduce or eliminate some topics to accommodate others, resulting in controversial decisions. The initial 15th edition (1974–1985) was faulted for having reduced or eliminated coverage of children's literature, military decorations, and the French poet Joachim du Bellay; editorial mistakes were also alleged, such as inconsistent sorting of Japanese biographies.   Its elimination of the index was condemned, as was the apparently arbitrary division of articles into the  and .    Summing up, one critic called the initial 15th edition a  " qualified failure... & #91;that & #93; cares more for juggling its format than for preserving. "     More recently, reviewers from the American Library Association were surprised to find that most educational articles had been eliminated from the 1992 , along with the article on psychology.  
 
 Some very few ''Britannica''-appointed contributors are mistaken. A notorious instance from the ''Britannica's'' early years is the rejection of Newtonian gravity by George Gleig, the chief editor of the 3rd edition (1788–1797), who wrote that gravity was caused by the fire (classical element)|classical element of fire.   The ''Britannica'' has also staunchly defended a scientific approach to cultural topics, as it did with William Robertson Smith's articles on religion in the 9th edition, particularly his article stating that the Bible was not historically accurate (1875).  
 
 === Other criticisms === 
  
 The ''Britannica'' has received criticism, especially as editions become outdated. It is expensive to produce a completely new edition of the ''Britannica'', and its editors delay for as long as fiscally sensible (usually about 25 years).   For example, despite continuous revision, the 14th edition became outdated after 35 years (1929–1964). When American physicist Harvey Einbinder detailed its failings in his 1964 book, ''The Myth of the Britannica'',     the encyclopaedia was provoked to produce the 15th edition, which required 10 years of work.   It is still difficult to keep the ''Britannica'' current; one recent critic writes,  " it is not difficult to find articles that are out-of-date or in need of revision " , noting that the longer  articles are more likely to be outdated than the shorter  articles.   Information in the  is sometimes inconsistent with the corresponding  article(s), mainly because of the failure to update one or the other.    The bibliographies of the  articles have been criticized for being more out-of-date than the articles themselves.    
 
 In 2010 an inaccurate entry about the Irish Civil War was discussed in the Irish press following a decision of the Department of Education and Skills (Ireland)|Department of Education and Science to pay for online access.     Sheehy, Clodagh (4 February 2010). [  " Are they taking the Mick? It's the encyclopedia that thinks the Civil War was between the north and south " ]. ''Evening Herald'' (Dublin).  
 
 Writing about the 3rd edition (1788–1797), ''Britannica''s chief editor George Gleig observed that  " perfection seems to be incompatible with the nature of works constructed on such a plan, and embracing such a variety of subjects. "     In March 2006, the ''Britannica'' wrote,  " we in no way mean to imply that ''Britannica'' is error-free; we have never made such a claim. "   The sentiment is expressed by its original editor, William Smellie (encyclopedist)|William Smellie: 
 
  regard to errors in general, whether falling under the denomination of mental, typographical or accidental, we are conscious of being able to point out a greater number than any critic whatever. Men who are acquainted with the innumerable difficulties attending the execution of a work of such an extensive nature will make proper allowances. To these we appeal, and shall rest satisfied with the judgment they pronounce.  William Smellie in the s: Preface to the 1st edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica|Preface to the 1st edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica  }} 
 
 However, Jorge Cauz (president of Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.) asserted in 2012 that  " ''Britannica'' [...] will always be factually correct. "

 The present owner of Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. is Jacqui Safra, a Brazilian billionaire and actor. Recent advances in information technology and the rise of electronic encyclopaedias such as Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite, ''Encarta'' and Wikipedia have reduced the demand for print encyclopaedias.   To remain competitive, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. has stressed the reputation of the ''Britannica'', reduced its price and production costs, and developed electronic versions on CD-ROM, DVD, and the World Wide Web. Since the early 1930s, the company has promoted spin-off reference works.   Aside from providing an excellent summary of the ''Britannica's'' history and early spin-off products, this article also describes the life-cycle of a typical ''Britannica'' edition. A new edition typically begins with strong sales that decay as the encyclopaedia becomes outdated. When work on a new edition is begun, sales of the old edition stop, just when fiscal needs are greatest: a new editorial staff must be assembled, articles commissioned. Elkan Harrison Powell identified this fluctuation of income as a danger to any encyclopaedia, one he hoped to overcome with continuous revision.  
 
 === Editions === 
 The ''Britannica'' has been issued in 15 editions, with multi-volume supplements to the 3rd and 4th editions (see the #Edition summary|Table below). The 5th and 6th editions were reprints of the 4th, the 10th edition was only a supplement to the 9th, just as the 12th and 13th editions were supplements to the 11th. The 15th underwent massive re-organization in 1985, but the updated, current version is still known as the 15th. The 14th and 15th editions were edited every year throughout their runs, so that later printings of each were entirely different from early ones. 
 
 Throughout history, the ''Britannica'' has had two aims: to be an excellent reference book, and to provide educational material.     In 1974, the 15th edition adopted a third goal: to systematize all human knowledge.  | pages = 5–8| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}   The history of the ''Britannica'' can be divided into five eras, punctuated by changes in management, or re-organization of the dictionary. 
 
 ==== 1768–1826 ==== 
 File:Rosetta Stone.jpg|thumb|right|The early 19th-century editions of  included influential, original research such as Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young's article on Egypt, which included the translation of the Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs on the Rosetta Stone (pictured). 
 In the first era (1st–6th editions, 1768–1826), the ''Britannica'' was managed and published by its founders, Colin Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell (engraver)|Andrew Bell, by Archibald Constable, and by others. The ''Britannica'' was first published between December 1768     and 1771 in Edinburgh as the ''Encyclopædia Britannica, or, A Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, compiled upon a New Plan''. In part, it was conceived in reaction to the French ''Encyclopédie'' of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert (published 1751–72), which had been inspired by Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Chambers's ''Cyclopaedia'' (first edition 1728). It went on sale 10 December.   [  " Encyclopædia Britannica " ]  
 
 The ''Britannica'' of this period was primarily a Scottish enterprise, and it is one of the most enduring legacies of the Scottish Enlightenment.     In this era, the ''Britannica'' moved from being a three-volume set (1st edition) compiled by one young editor—William Smellie (encyclopedist)|William Smellie   The ''Britannica's'' 1st edition is described as  " deplorably inaccurate and unscientific "  in places.  —to a 20-volume set written by numerous authorities.   Several other encyclopaedias competed throughout this period, among them editions of Abraham Rees's ''Cyclopædia'' and Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge's ''Encyclopædia Metropolitana'' and David Brewster's ''Edinburgh Encyclopædia''. 
 
 ==== 1827–1901 ==== 
 During the second era (7th–9th editions, 1827–1901), the ''Britannica'' was managed by the Edinburgh publishing firm A  &  C Black. Although some contributors were again recruited through friendships of the chief editors, notably Macvey Napier, others were attracted by the ''Britannica's'' reputation. The contributors often came from other countries and included the world's most respected authorities in their fields. A general index of all articles was included for the first time in the 7th edition, a practice maintained until 1974. 
 
 Production of the 9th edition was overseen by Thomas Spencer Baynes, the first English-born editor-in-chief. Dubbed the  " Scholar's Edition " , the 9th edition is the most scholarly of all ''Britannicas''.      After 1880, Baynes was assisted by William Robertson Smith.     No biographies of living persons were included.     James Clerk Maxwell and Thomas Huxley were special advisors on science.     However, by the close of the 19th century, the 9th edition was outdated, and the ''Britannica'' faced financial difficulties. 
 
 ==== 1901–1973 ==== 
 File:EncycBrit1913.jpg|left|thumb|US advertisement for the 11th edition from the May 1913 issue of ''National Geographic Magazine'' 
 
 In the third era (10th–14th editions, 1901–1973), the ''Britannica'' was managed by American businessmen who introduced direct marketing and door-to-door sales. The American owners gradually simplified articles, making them less scholarly for a mass market. The 10th edition was an eleven-volume supplement (including one each of maps and an index) to the 9th, numbered as volumes 25–35, but the 11th edition was a completely new work, and is still praised for excellence; its owner, Horace Everett Hooper|Horace Hooper, lavished enormous effort on its perfection.  
 
 When Hooper fell into financial difficulties, the ''Britannica'' was managed by Sears Roebuck for 18 years (1920–1923, 1928–1943). In 1932, the vice-president of Sears, Elkan Harrison Powell, assumed presidency of the ''Britannica''; in 1936, he began the policy of continuous revision. This was a departure from earlier practice, in which the articles were not changed until a new edition was produced, at roughly 25-year intervals, some articles unchanged from earlier editions.   Powell developed new educational products that built upon the ''Britannica''s reputation.

 In 1943, Sears donated the  to the University of Chicago. William Benton (senator)|William Benton, then a vice president of the University, provided the working capital for its operation. The stock was divided between Benton and the University, with the University holding an option on the stock.  ''Chicago Tribune'', 22 February 1945   Benton became chairman of the board and managed the ''Britannica'' until his death in 1973.  ''Chicago Tribune'', 28 January 1943   Benton set up the Benton Foundation, which managed the ''Britannica'' until 1996, and whose sole beneficiary was the University of Chicago.     In 1968, near the end of this era, the ''Britannica'' celebrated Bicentennial of the Encyclopædia Britannica|its bicentennial. 
 
 ==== 1974–1994 ==== 
 In the fourth era (1974–94), the ''Britannica'' introduced its 15th edition, which was re-organized into three parts: the , the , and the . Under Mortimer J. Adler (member of the Board of Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica since its inception in 1949, and its chair from 1974; director of editorial planning for the 15th edition of ''Britannica'' from 1965),  Mortimer J. Adler, ''A Guidebook to Learning: for the lifelong pursuit of wisdom''. Macmillan Publishing Company, New York, 1986, p. 88   the ''Britannica'' sought not only to be a good reference work and educational tool, but to systematize all human knowledge. The absence of a separate index and the grouping of articles into parallel encyclopaedias (the  and ) provoked a  " firestorm of criticism "  of the initial 15th edition.

This second version of the 15th edition continued to be published and revised until the 2010 print version. The official title of the 15th edition is the ''New Encyclopædia Britannica'', although it has also been promoted as ''Britannica 3''.  
 
 On 9 March 1976 the US Federal Trade Commission entered an opinion and order enjoining Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. from using: a) deceptive advertising practices in recruiting sales agents and obtaining sales leads, and b) deceptive sales practices in the door-to-door presentations of its sales agents.    
 
 ==== 1994–present ==== 
 File:Eb advert 1898.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for the 9th edition (1898) 
 In the fifth era (1994–present), digital versions have been developed and released on Optical disc|optical media and online. In 1996, the ''Britannica'' was bought by Jacqui Safra at well below its estimated value, owing to the company's financial difficulties. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. split in 1999. One part retained the company name and developed the print version, and the other, Britannica.com Inc., developed digital versions. Since 2001, the two companies have shared a CEO, Ilan Yeshua, who has continued Powell's strategy of introducing new products with the ''Britannica'' name. In March 2012, Britannica's president, Jorge Cauz, announced that it would not produce any new print editions of the encyclopaedia, with the 2010 15th edition being the last. The company will focus only on the online edition and other educational tools.     
 
 ''Britannica''s final print edition was in 2010, a 32-volume set.   ''Britannica Global Edition'' was also printed in 2010. It contained 30 volumes and 18,251 pages, with 8,500 photographs, maps, flags, and illustrations in smaller  " compact "  volumes. It contained over 40,000 articles written by scholars from across the world, including Nobel Prize winners. Unlike the 15th edition, it did not contain  and  sections, but ran A through Z as all editions up to the 14th had. The following is ''Britannica''s description of the work:  
 
 , the world standard in reference since 1768, present the ''Britannica Global Edition''. Developed specifically to provide comprehensive and global coverage of the world around us, this unique product contains thousands of timely, relevant, and essential articles drawn from the  itself, as well as from the ''Britannica Concise Encyclopedia'', the ''Britannica Encyclopedia of World Religions'', and Compton's by Britannica. Written by international experts and scholars, the articles in this collection reflect the standards that have been the hallmark of the leading English-language encyclopedia for over 240 years.}} 
 
 === Dedications === 
 The ''Britannica'' was Dedication (publishing)|dedicated to the reigning British monarchy|British monarch from 1788 to 1901 and then, upon its sale to an American partnership, to the British monarch and the President of the United States.   Thus, the 11th edition is  " dedicated by Permission to His Majesty George V of the United Kingdom|George the Fifth, King of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, and to William Howard Taft, President of the United States of America. "     The order of the dedications has changed with the relative power of the United States and Britain, and with relative sales; the 1954 version of the 14th edition is  " Dedicated by Permission to the Heads of the Two English-Speaking Peoples, Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight David Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, and Her Majesty, Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth the Second. "     Consistent with this tradition, the 2007 version of the current 15th edition was  " dedicated by permission to the current President of the United States of America, George W. Bush, and Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II " ,   | page = 3| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. | year = 1991 }}   while the 2010 version of the current 15th edition is  " dedicated by permission to Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

  2   The 7th to 14th editions included a separate index volume. 
 
  3   The 9th edition featured articles by notables of the day, such as James Clerk Maxwell on electricity and magnetism, and William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (who became Lord Kelvin) on heat.
