Written between 1873 and 1884, it traces four generations of the Pontifex family. Butler dared not publish it during his lifetime, but when it was published (in 1903) it was accepted as part of the general reaction against Victorian morality|Victorianism. In its posthumous publication in 1903, Butler's first literary executor, R.A. Streatfeild, made substantial changes to Butler's manuscript. The original manuscript was first published in 1964 by Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston, edited by Daniel F. Howard.    
 
 The title is a common misquotation of a Biblical Hebrew expression, to  " go the way of all the earth " , meaning  " to die "  (1 Kings 2:2). 
 
 In 1998, the Modern Library ranked ''The Way of All Flesh'' twelfth on its list of the Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

 ==Plot summary== 
 The story is narrated by Overton, godfather to the central character. 
 
 The novel takes its beginnings in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries to trace Ernest's emergence from previous generations of the Pontifex family. John Pontifex was a carpenter; his son George rises in the world to become a publisher; George's son Theobald, pressed by his father to become a minister, is manipulated into marrying Christina, the daughter of a clergyman; the main character Ernest Pontifex is the eldest son of Theobald and Christina. 
 
 The author depicts an antagonistic relationship between Ernest and his hypocritical and domineering parents. His aunt Alethea is aware of this relationship, but dies before she can fulfill her aim of counteracting the parents' malign influence on the boy. However, shortly before her death she secretly passes a small fortune into Overton's keeping, with the agreement that once Ernest is twenty-eight, he can receive it. 
 
 As Ernest develops into a young man, he travels a bumpy theological road, reflecting the divisions and controversies in the Church of England in the Victorian era. Easily influenced by others at university, he starts out as an Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian, and soon becomes a clergyman. He then falls for the lures of the High Church (and is duped out of much of his own money by a fellow clergyman). He decides that the way to regenerate the Church of England is to live among the poor, but the results are, first, that his faith in the integrity of the Bible is severely damaged by a conversation with one of the poor he was hoping to redeem, and, second, that under the pressures of poverty and theological doubt, he attempts a sexual assault on a woman he has incorrectly believed to be of loose morals. 
 
 This assault leads to a prison term. His parents disown him. His health deteriorates. 
 
 As he recovers he learns how to tailor and decides to make this his profession once out of prison. He loses his Christian faith. He marries Ellen, a former housemaid of his parents; they have two children and set up shop together in the second-hand clothing industry. However, in due course he discovers that Ellen is both a bigamist and an alcoholic. Overton at this point intervenes and pays Ellen a stipend, and she happily leaves with another for America. He gives Ernest a job, and takes him on a trip to Continental Europe. 
 
 In due course Ernest becomes 28, and receives his aunt Alethea's gift. He returns to the family home until his mother's death; his father's influence over him wanes as Theobald's own position as a clergyman is reduced in relative stature, though to the end Theobald purposefully finds small ways to annoy him. Ernest becomes an author of controversial literature.

 The writer George Orwell praised the novel and called it  " a great book because it gives an honest picture of the relationship between father and son, and it could do that because Butler was a truly independent observer, and above all because he was courageous. He would say things that other people knew but didn't dare to say. And finally there was his clear, simple, straightforward way of writing, never using a long word where a short one will do. "  George Orwell, BBC Home Service, Talks for Schools, 15 June 1945, reprinted in Collected Works, ''I Belong to the Left'', p. 186  
 
 A. A. Milne, author of ''Winnie-the-Pooh'', wrote about it in one of his essays  " A Household Book " , published in a collection of his essays, ''Not That It Matters'': 
 " Once upon a time I discovered Samuel Butler; not the other two, but the one who wrote ''The Way of All Flesh'', the second-best novel in the English language. I say the second-best, so that, if you remind me of ''Tom Jones'', or ''The Mayor of Casterbridge'', or any other that you fancy, I can say, of course, that one is the best. "
