 According to Carroll, 
 :“The Skeptic’s Dictionary is aimed at four distinct audiences: the open-minded seeker, who makes no commitment to or disavowal of occult claims; the soft skeptic, who is more prone to doubt than to believe; the hardened skeptic, who has strong disbelief about all things occult; and the believing doubter, who is prone to believe but has some doubts. The one group this book is not aimed at is the 'True-believer syndrome|true believer' in the occult. If you have no skepticism in you, this book is not for you.” 
 
 Carroll defines each of these categories, explaining how and why, in his opinion, his dictionary may be of interest, use, and benefit to each of them. He also defines the term “skepticism” as he uses it and identifies two types of skeptic, the Apollonian, who is “committed to clarity and rationality” and the Dionysian, who is “committed to passion and instinct.” William James, Bertrand Russell, and Friedrich Nietzsche exemplify the Apollonian skeptic, Carroll says, and Charles Sanders Peirce, Tertullian, Søren Kierkegaard, and Blaise Pascal are Dionysian skeptics.

 ==Reception== 
 Roy Herbert's review of the paperback version written for the ''New Scientist'' magazine commented that  " it is an amazing assembly, elegantly written and level-headed, with a wry remark here and there " , and that  " this superb work is likely to be used so often that it is a pity it is a softback book. " .   Skeptical Inquirer stated that it was  " a book that should be a staple of everyone’s diet-part of the package we are given at birth to help us avoid the dangers and pitfalls of living in a world riddled with bad ideas and empty promises... " .     It was also described by Gary Jason, a Philosophy professor at California State University as  " ... a good reference book for a critical thinking class. "
