It traces Western culture|Western civilization (as well as the Muslim conquests|Islamic and Mongolian Empire|Mongolian conquests) from the Nerva–Antonine dynasty|height of the Roman Empire to the Fall of Constantinople|fall of Byzantine Empire|Byzantium. Volume & nbsp;I was published in 1776 and went through six printings.     Volumes & nbsp;II and III were published in 1781;        volumes & nbsp;IV, V, and VI in 1788–1789.           The original volumes were published in quarto sections, a common publishing practice of the time.  
 
 The six volumes cover the history, from 98 to 1590, of the Roman Empire, the history of early Christianity and then of the State church of the Roman Empire|Roman State Church, and the history of Europe, and discusses the decline of the Roman Empire among other things. 
 
 == Thesis == 
 Gibbon offers an explanation for the Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire, a task made difficult by a lack of comprehensive written sources, though he was not the only historian to attempt it. 
 
 According to Gibbon, the Roman Empire succumbed to barbarian invasions in large part due to the gradual loss of civic virtue among its citizens.  J.G.A. Pocock,  " Between Machiavelli and Hume: Gibbon as Civic Humanist and Philosophical Historian, "  ''Daedalus'' 105:3 (1976), 153–169; and in #Further reading|Further reading: Pocock, ''The Enlightenments of Edward Gibbon, 1737–1764'', 303–304; ''The First Decline and Fall'', 304–306.    
 He began an ongoing controversy about the role of Christianity, but he gave great weight to other causes of internal decline and to Migration Period|attacks from outside the Empire.  
 
 Like other The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment thinkers and Kingdom of Great Britain|British citizens of the age steeped in institutional anti-Catholicism, Gibbon held in contempt the Medievalism|Middle Ages as a priest-ridden, superstitious Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Age.  It was not until his own era, the  " Age of Reason " , with its emphasis on rational thought, it was believed, that human history could resume its progress.  ; and in #Further reading|Further reading: Pocock, ''The Enlightenments of Edward Gibbon, 1737–1764'', 303–304; ''The First Decline and Fall'', 304–306.

 Gibbon's tone was detached, dispassionate, and yet critical. He can lapse into moralisation and aphorism:

 === Citations and footnotes === 
 Gibbon provides the reader with a glimpse of his thought process with extensive notes along the body of the text, a precursor to the modern use of footnotes. Gibbon's footnotes are famous for their idiosyncratic and often humorous style, and have been called  " Gibbon's table talk. "     They provide an entertaining moral commentary on both ancient Rome and 18th & nbsp;century Great Britain. This technique enabled Gibbon to compare ancient Rome to his own contemporary world. Gibbon's work advocates a rationalist and Progressivism|progressive view of history. 
 
 Gibbon's citations provide in-depth detail regarding his use of sources for his work, which included documents dating back to ancient Rome. The detail within his asides and his care in noting the importance of each document is a precursor to modern-day historical footnoting methodology. 
 
 The work is notable for its erratic but exhaustively documented notes and research. J.B. Bury|John Bury, following him 113 & nbsp;years later with his own ''History of the Later Roman Empire'', commended the depth and accuracy of Gibbon's work. Unusually for 18th & nbsp;century historians, Gibbon was not content with second-hand accounts when primary sources were accessible.  " I have always endeavoured " , Gibbon wrote,  " to draw from the fountain-head; that my curiosity, as well as a sense of duty, has always urged me to study the originals; and that, if they have sometimes eluded my search, I have carefully marked the secondary evidence, on whose faith a passage or a fact were reduced to depend. "     The ''Decline and Fall'' is a literary monument and a massive step forward in historical method.   }} 
 
 ==Criticism== 
 Numerous tracts were published criticising his work. In response, Gibbon defended his work with the 1779 publication of ''A Vindication ... of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire''.     His remarks on Christianity aroused particularly vigorous attacks, but in the mid-twentieth century, at least one author claimed that  " church historians allow the substantial justness of [Gibbon's] main positions. "  ''The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge'', vol. IV, eds. S.M. Jackson, et al. (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Book House, 1952), 483–484. [ online].  
 
 ===Misinterpretation of Byzantium=== 
 Some historians such as John Julius Norwich, despite their admiration for his furthering of historical methodology, consider Gibbon's hostile views on the Byzantine Empire flawed and blame him somewhat for the lack of interest shown in the subject throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries.  John Julius Norwich, ''Byzantium'' (New York: Knopf, 1989); ''Byzantium: the apogee'' (London and New York: Viking Press, 1991).   This view might well be admitted by Gibbon himself:  " But it is not my intention to expatiate with the same minuteness on the whole series of the Byzantine history. "  [ Preface of 1782 online].   However, the Russian historian George Ostrogorsky writes,  " Gibbon and Charles le Beau|Lebeau were genuine historians & nbsp;– and Gibbon a very great one & nbsp;– and their works, in spite of factual inadequacy, rank high for their presentation of their material. "  Georgije Ostrogorski  [ & tbm=bks & q=%22gibbon+and+lebeau+were+genuine+historians%22 & num=10 ''History of the Byzantine State'' (1986) p. 5 online]  
 
 ==Gibbon's views on religion== 
 
 ===Criticism of Quran and Muhammad=== 
 
 Gibbon's comments on the Quran and Muhammad reflected his Criticism of Islam|anti-Islamic views. He outlined in chapter 33 the widespread tale of the Seven Sleepers,  Rashid Iqbal, (2017). “A New Theory on Aṣḥāb al-kahf (The Sleepers of the Cave) Based on Evidence from the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS)”. Al-Bayān – Journal of Qurʾān and ḤadĪth Studies 15 (2017). . pp. 20–47. Retrieved from    and remarked  " This popular tale, which Mahomet might learn when he drove his camels to the fairs of Syria, is introduced, as a Revelation|divine revelation, into the Quran. "  His presentation of Muhammad's life again reflected his anti-Islamic views:  " in his private conduct, Mahomet indulged the appetites of a man, and abused the claims of a prophet. A special revelation dispensed him from the laws which he had imposed on his nation: the female sex, without reserve, was abandoned to his desires; and this singular prerogative excited the envy, rather than the scandal, the veneration, rather than the envy, of the devout Mussulmans. "    
 
 ===Views on Jews and charge of antisemitism=== 
 Gibbon has been accused of antisemitism.     He has described the Jews as  " a race of fanatics, whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render them the implacable enemies not only of the Roman government, but also of humankind. "  Gibbon, Edward.  " Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire " , p. 521 in the first volume.  
 
 ===Number of Christian martyrs=== 
 Gibbon challenged Church history by estimating far smaller numbers of Christian martyrs than had been traditionally accepted. The Church's version of its early history had rarely been questioned before. Gibbon, however, knew that modern Church writings were secondary sources, and he shunned them in favor of primary sources. 
 
 ===Christianity as a contributor to the fall and to stability: chapters XV, XVI=== 
 Historian S. P. Foster says that Gibbon: 
 :blamed the otherworldly preoccupations of Christianity for the decline of the Roman empire, heaped scorn and abuse on the church, and sneered at the entirety of monasticism as a dreary, superstition-ridden enterprise. The ''Decline and Fall'' compares Christianity invidiously with both the pagan religions of Rome and the religion of Islam.    
 
 Volume I was originally published in sections, as was common for large works at the time. The first two were well received and widely praised. The last quarto in Volume I, especially Chapters XV and XVI, was highly controversial, and Gibbon was attacked as a  " paganism|paganist " . Gibbon thought that Christianity had hastened the Fall, but also ameliorated the results: 
 
  
 
 Voltaire was deemed to have influenced Gibbon's claim that Christianity was a contributor to the fall of the Roman Empire.  As one pro-Christian commenter put it in 1840: 
 
   }} 
 
 ===Tolerant paganism=== 
 
 Gibbon wrote: 
 
  He has been criticized for his portrayal of Paganism as tolerant and Christianity as intolerant. In an article that appeared in 1996 in the journal ''Past  &  Present (journal)|Past  &  Present'', H. A. Drake challenges an understanding of Persecution of religion in ancient Rome|religious persecution in ancient Rome, which he considers to be the  " conceptual scheme "  that was used by historians to deal with the topic for the last 200 years, and whose most eminent representative is Gibbon. Drake counters: 
 
  
 
 ==Gibbon's reflections== 
 Gibbon's initial plan was to write a history  " ''of the decline and fall of the ''city'' of Rome'' " , and only later expanded his scope to the whole Roman Empire:   If I prosecute this ''History'', I shall not be unmindful of the decline and fall of the ''city'' of Rome; an interesting object, to which my plan was originally confined.     
 
 Although he published other books, Gibbon devoted much of his life to this one work (1772–1789). His autobiography Miscellaneous Works of Edward Gibbon#The Miscellaneous Works|''Memoirs of My Life and Writings'' is devoted largely to his reflections on how the book virtually ''became'' his life. He compared the publication of each succeeding volume to a newborn child.    
 
 ==Editions== 
 Gibbon continued to revise and change his work even after publication. The complexities of the problem are addressed in Womersley's introduction and appendices to his complete edition.

 == Legacy == 
  
 Many writers have used variations on the series title (including using  " Rise and Fall "  in place of  " Decline and Fall " ), especially when dealing with a large polity that has imperial characteristics. Piers Brendon notes that Gibbon's work  " became the essential guide for Britons anxious to plot their own imperial trajectory. They found the key to understanding the British Empire in the ruins of Rome. "  Piers Brendon, ''The Decline and Fall of the British Empire, 1781–1997'' (2008) p. xv.

 The title and author are also cited in Noël Coward's comedic poem  " I Went to a Marvellous Party " , and in the poem  " The Foundation of S.F. Success|The Foundation of Science Fiction Success " , Isaac Asimov acknowledged that his Foundation series|''Foundation'' series – an epic tale of the fall and rebuilding of a galactic empire – was written  " ''with a tiny bit of cribbin' / from the works of Edward Gibbon'' " .     Feminist science fiction author Sheri S. Tepper gave one of her novels the title ''Gibbon's Decline and Fall''. 
 
 In 1995, an established journal of classical scholarship, ''Classics Ireland'', published Punk rock|punk musician's Iggy Pop's reflections on the applicability of ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' to the modern world in a short article, ''Caesar Lives'', (vol. & nbsp;2, 1995) in which he noted  America is Rome. Of course, why shouldn't it be? We are all Roman children, for better or worse ... I learn much about the way our society really works, because the system-origins – military, religious, political, colonial, agricultural, financial – are all there to be scrutinised in their infancy. I have gained perspective.
