Alternatingly slow moving and fast paced, it focuses on four anthropomorphised animals: Mole, Rat (a European water vole), Mr. Toad|Toad, and Badger. They live in a pastoral version of Edwardian England.  
 
 In 1908 Grahame retired from his position as secretary of the Bank of England. He moved back to Berkshire, where he had lived as a child, and spent his time by the River Thames, doing much as the animal characters in his book do & nbsp;– to quote,  " simply messing about in boats " & nbsp;– and expanding the bedtime stories he had earlier told his son Alastair into a manuscript for the book. 
 
 The novel was in its 31st printing when A. A. Milne adapted part of it for the stage as ''Toad of Toad Hall'' in 1929. The first film adaptation was produced by Walt Disney as one of two segments in the 1949 package film ''The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad''. 
 
 In 2003 ''The Wind in the Willows'' was listed at #16 in the BBC's survey The Big Read.     More than a century after its original publication, it was adapted again for the stage, as a 2014 The Wind in the Willows (musical)|musical by Julian Fellowes. In his preface, A. A. Milne writes,  
  
 
 ==Background== 
  
 Kenneth Grahame was born on 8 & nbsp;March 1859 in Edinburgh. When he was 5, his mother died from puerperal fever, and his father, who had a drinking problem, gave the care of his four children over to their grandmother, who lived in Cookham Dean in Berkshire. There they lived in a spacious but dilapidated home, ''The Mount'', in extensive grounds by the River Thames, and were introduced to the riverside and boating by their uncle, David Ingles, curate at Cookham Dean church.    
 
 At Christmas 1865 the chimney of the house collapsed and the children moved to Fern Hill Cottage in Cranbourne, Berkshire. In 1866, their father tried to overcome his drinking problem and took the children back to live with him in Argyll, Scotland, but after a year they returned to their grandmother's house in Cranbourne, where Kenneth lived until he entered St Edward's School, Oxford in 1868.     During his early years at St. & nbsp;Edwards the boys were free to explore the old city with its quaint shops, historic buildings, and cobbled streets, St Giles' Fair, the idyllic upper reaches of the River Thames, and the nearby countryside.    
 
 Grahame married Elspeth Thomson, the daughter of Robert William Thomson in 1899, when he was 40; the next year they had their only child, a boy named Alastair (whose nickname was  " Mouse " ) born premature, blind in one eye, and plagued by health problems throughout his life.     When Alastair was about four years old, Grahame would tell him bedtime stories, some of which were about a toad, and on his frequent boating holidays without his family he would write further tales of Toad, Mole, Ratty, and Badger in letters to Alastair.  
 
 In 1908 Grahame took early retirement from his job at the Bank of England and moved with his wife and son to an old farmhouse in Blewbury, where he used the bedtime stories he had told Alastair as a basis for the manuscript of ''The Wind in the Willows''.  
 
 ==Plot summary== 
 ===Mole meets Rat=== 
 With the arrival of spring and fine weather outside, the good-natured Mole loses patience with spring cleaning. He has fled his underground home, emerging to take in the air and ends up at the river, which he has never seen before. Here he meets Rat (a European Water Vole|water vole), who at this time of year spends all his days in, on and close by the river. Rat takes Mole for a ride in his rowing boat. They get along well and spend many more days boating, with “Ratty” teaching Mole the ways of the river, with the two friends living together in Ratty's riverside home. 
 
 ===Toad=== 
 One summer day, Rat and Mole disembark near the grand Toad Hall (The Wind in the Willows)|Toad Hall and pay a visit to Toad. Toad is rich, jovial, friendly and kindhearted, but aimless and conceited; he regularly becomes obsessed with current fads, only to abandon them abruptly. Having recently given up boating, Toad's current craze is his horse-drawn caravan. He persuades the reluctant Rat and willing Mole to join him on a trip. Toad soon tires of the realities of camp life, and sleeps in the following day to avoid chores. Later that day, a passing motorcar scares the horse, causing the caravan to overturn into a ditch. Rat threatens to have the law on the car driver, while Mole calms the horse, but Toad's craze for caravan travel is immediately replaced by an obsession with motorcars. The result of this obsession is that every time he sees a motorcar he immediately wants to ride in it, despite his friends' numerous efforts to stop him. 
 
 ===The Wild Wood and Badger=== 
 Mole wants to meet the respected but elusive Badger, who lives deep in the Wild Wood, but Rat & nbsp;– knowing that Badger does not appreciate visits & nbsp;– tells Mole to be patient and wait for Badger to pay them a visit himself. Nevertheless, on a snowy winter's day, while the seasonally somnolent Rat dozes, Mole impulsively goes to the Wild Wood to explore, hoping to meet Badger. He gets lost in the woods, sees many  " evil faces "  among the wood's less-welcoming denizens, succumbs to fright and panic and hides, trying to stay warm, among the sheltering roots of a tree. 
 
 Rat wakes to find Mole gone. Guessing his mission from the direction of Mole's tracks and equipping himself with two pistols and a stout cudgel, Rat goes in search, finding him as snow begins to fall in earnest. Attempting to find their way home, Rat and Mole quite literally stumble across Badger's home & nbsp;– Mole barks his shin on the boot scraper on Badger's doorstep. Badger & nbsp;– en route to bed in his dressing gown and slippers & nbsp;– nonetheless warmly welcomes Rat and Mole to his large and cosy underground home, providing them with hot food, dry clothes, and reassuring conversation:  " It takes all sorts to make a world. " 
 
 ===Toad and motorcars=== 
 Badger learns from his visitors that Toad has crashed seven cars, has been in hospital three times, and has spent a fortune on fines. Though nothing can be done at the moment (it being winter), they resolve that when the time is right they will make a plan to protect Toad from himself; they are, after all, his friends, and are worried about his well being. 
 
 With the arrival of spring, Badger visits Mole and Rat to take action over Toad's self-destructive obsession. The three of them go to Toad Hall, and Badger tries talking Toad out of his behavior, to no avail. They then put Toad under house arrest, threatening to keep him there until he changes his mind, with themselves as the guards. Feigning illness, Toad bamboozles Rat (who is on guard duty at the time) and escapes. 
 
 Badger and Mole are cross with Rat for his gullibility, but draw comfort from this, because they need no longer waste their summer guarding Toad. However, Badger and Mole continue to live in Toad Hall in the hope that Toad may return. Meanwhile, Toad orders lunch at The Red Lion Inn, and then sees a motorcar pull into the courtyard. Taking the car, he drives it recklessly and is caught by the police. He is sent to prison for 20 & nbsp;years. 
 
 ===Toad escapes from prison=== 
 In prison, Toad begins to have an epiphany about his careless ways, feeling guilty for not listening to his friends before. He later gains the sympathy of the gaoler's daughter, who helps him to escape disguised as a washerwoman. Though free again, Toad is without money or possessions other than the clothes upon his back. He manages to board a railway engine manned by a sympathetic driver, which is then pursued by a special train loaded with policemen, detectives and prison warders. Toad jumps from the train and, still disguised as a washerwoman, comes across a horse-drawn boat|horse-drawn barge. The barge's female owner offers him a lift in exchange for Toad's services as a washerwoman. After he botches the wash, Toad gets into a fight with the barge woman, who tosses him into the canal. In revenge, Toad makes off with the barge horse, which he then sells to a Romani people|gypsy. 
 
 Toad subsequently flags down a passing car, which happens to be the very one he stole earlier. The car's owners, not recognising Toad in his disguise, permit him to drive their car. Once behind the wheel, he is repossessed by his former exuberance and drives furiously, declaring his true identity to the passengers, who then try to seize him. This leads to the car losing control and crashing into a bush, then flying through the air, landing in a horse pond, after which Toad flees once more. Spotting police gaining on him, he flees away and falls into the river, which carries him by sheer chance to the hole of the Water Rat. 
 
 ===Recapture of Toad Hall=== 
 After being hauled inside by the Rat, Toad is told that Toad Hall has been taken over by weasels and stoats from the Wild Wood, who have driven out Mole and Badger. Although upset at the loss of his house, Toad realizes what good friends he has and how badly he has behaved. Badger then arrives and announces that he knows of a secret tunnel into Toad Hall through which the enemies may be attacked. Armed to the teeth, Badger, Rat, Mole and Toad enter through the tunnel and pounce upon the unsuspecting Wild-Wooders who are holding a celebratory party. Having driven away the intruders, Toad holds a banquet to mark his return, during which (for a change) he behaves both quietly and humbly. He makes up for his earlier excesses by seeking out and compensating those he has wronged, and the four friends live out their lives happily ever after. 
 
 ===Short stories=== 
 In addition to the main narrative, the book contains several independent short stories featuring Rat and Mole. These appear for the most part between the chapters chronicling Toad's adventures, and are often omitted from abridgements and dramatisations. The chapter  " Dulce Domum "  describes Mole's return to his home with Rat where he rediscovers, with Rat's help, a familiar comfort, despite finding it in a terrible mess after his abortive spring clean.  " The Piper at the Gates of Dawn "  tells how Mole and Rat search for Otter's missing son Portly, whom they find in the care of the god Pan (god)|Pan. (Pan removes their memories of this meeting  " ''lest the awful remembrance should remain and grow, and overshadow mirth and pleasure'' " .) Finally, in  " Wayfarers All " , Ratty shows a restless side to his character when he is sorely tempted to join a Black rat|Sea Rat on his travelling adventures. 
 
 ==Main characters== 
 *European mole|Mole: known as  " Moly "  to his friends. An altruistic, humble, loyal, polite, home-loving animal, and the first character introduced in the story. Fed up with spring cleaning in his secluded home, he ventures into the outside world. Initially overawed by the hustle and bustle of the riverbank, he eventually adapts. He proves intelligent as shown with his Psychological warfare|trickery against the Wild Wooders before the assault to retake Toad Hall. 
 *European Water Vole|Rat: known as  " Ratty "  to his friends (though actually a European water vole|water vole), he is cultured, relaxed and friendly, and enjoys a life of leisure; when not spending time on the river, he composes doggerel. Ratty loves the river and takes charge of Mole. He can be stubborn when it comes to doing things outside his riverside lifestyle, but can do which must be done as shown when he risks his safety to help Mole in the Wild Wood and to help free Toad Hall from the weasels. 
 *Mr. Toad: known as  " Toady "  to his friends, the wealthy scion of Toad Hall who inherited his wealth from his late father. Although good-hearted and optimistic, he is also arrogant, conceited, and impulsive. He is prone to obsessions and crazes (such as punt (boat)|punting, houseboats, and horse-drawn caravans). Having a short-attention-span, he gets bored with each of these activities in turn and drops them, finally settling on motorcars. His motoring craze degenerates into a sort-of addiction that lands him in the hospital a few times, subjects him to stiff fines for his unlawfully reckless driving, and eventually gets him imprisoned for theft, dangerous-driving, and gross impertinence to the police. Two chapters of the book chronicle his daring escape from prison and subsequent adventures before meeting up with the Water Rat. 
 *European badger|Mr. & nbsp;Badger: a gruff-but-benevolent soul, Badger embodies the  " wise hermit "  figure. A friend of Toad's deceased father, he is uncompromising with the irresponsible Toad, yet hopes that his good qualities will prevail. He lives in a vast underground sett, part of which incorporates the remains of a buried Ancient Rome|Roman settlement. A brave and a skilled fighter, Badger helps clear the Wild-Wooders from Toad Hall with his large stick. 
 
 ==Supporting characters== 
 * European otter|Otter and Portly: a friend of Ratty with a stereotypical  " Cockney costermonger "  character. The extrovert Otter is tough and self-sufficient. Portly is his young son. 
 * The Least weasel|weasels, ferrets, and stoats: the story's main antagonists. They plot to take over Toad Hall. Although they are unnamed, the leader is referred to as  " Chief Weasel " . 
 * Pan (god)|Pan: a benevolent and wise god of the wild who makes a single, anomalous appearance in Chapter & nbsp;7,  " The Piper at the Gates of Dawn "  when he helps Portly and looks after him until Ratty and Mole come. 
 * The Gaoler's Daughter: the only major human character; a  " good, kind, clever girl " , she helps Toad escape from prison. 
 * The Wayfarer: a vagabond seafaring rat, who also makes a single appearance. Ratty briefly considers following his example, before Mole persuades him otherwise. 
 * Squirrels and rabbits, who are generally good (although rabbits are described as  " a mixed lot " ). 
 * Inhabitants of the Wild Wood: weasels, stoats, and Red fox|foxes who are described by Ratty as:  " All-right in a way but well, you can't really trust them " .

 ==Reception== 
 A number of publishers rejected the manuscript. It was published in the UK by Methuen Publishing|Methuen and Co., and later in the US by Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner. The critics, who were hoping for a third volume in the style of Grahame's earlier works; ''The Golden Age (Grahame)|The Golden Age'' and ''Dream Days'', generally gave negative reviews.   The public loved it, however, and within a few years it sold in such numbers that many reprints were required. In 1909, then sitting US President Theodore Roosevelt wrote to Grahame to tell him that he had  " read it and reread it, and have come to accept the characters as old friends " .  .  
 
 In ''The Enchanted Places'', Christopher Robin Milne wrote of ''The Wind in the Willows'':

 ===Sequels and alternative versions=== 
 * In 1983 Dixon Scott published ''A Fresh Wind in the Willows'', which not only predates Horwood's sequels (see below) by several years but also includes some of the same incidents, including a climax in which Toad steals a Bleriot monoplane. 
 * William Horwood (novelist)|William Horwood created several sequels to ''The Wind in the Willows'': ''The Willows in Winter'', ''Toad Triumphant'', ''The Willows and Beyond'', and ''The Willows at Christmas'' (1999). 
 * Jacqueline Kelly's sequel ''Return to the Willows'' was published in 2012. 
 * Jan Needle's ''Wild Wood'' was published in 1981 with illustrations by William Rushton (). It is a re-telling of the story of ''The Wind in the Willows'' from the point of view of the working-class inhabitants of the Wild Wood. For them, money is short and employment hard to find. They have a very different perspective on the wealthy, easy, careless lifestyle of Toad and his friends. 
 * Kij Johnson published ''The River Bank'' in 2017. If ''Wild Wood'' reimagined Grahame's work through a shift of class, Johnson's work may be said to do the same thing through shift of gender. 
 * Daniel Mallory Ortberg included the story  " Some of Us Had Been Threatening Our Friend Mr. Toad, "  which blends ''Wind in the Willows'' with the Donald Barthelme short story  " Some of Us Had Been Threatening Our Friend Colby, "  in his 2018 collection ''The Merry Spinster: Tales of Everyday Horror''. In Ortberg's retelling, Toad's friends are abusive and use the guise of  " rescuing "  their friend to justify violence and manipulation. 
 * Frederick Thurber's ''In the Wake of the Willows'' was published in 2019. It is the New World version of the original, recounting the adventures of the same set of characters, and their children, who lived on a coastal estuary in southern New England.

 Simon Winchester suggested that the character of Ratty was based on Frederick James Furnivall|Frederick Furnivall, a keen oarsman and acquaintance of Kenneth Grahame.     However, Grahame himself said that this character was inspired by his good friend, the writer Sir & nbsp;Arthur Quiller-Couch. Grahame wrote this in a signed copy he gave to Quiller-Couch's daughter, Foy Felicia.  The copy with Grahame's inscribed identification of Arthur Quiller-Couch as an inspiration for Ratty was auctioned by Bonhams on Tuesday 23 & nbsp;March 2010 for £32,400.  
 
 ''The Scotsman''     and ''Oban Times''     suggested  was inspired by the Crinan Canal because Grahame spent some of his childhood in Ardrishaig. 
 
 There is a proposal that the idea for the story arose when its author saw a water vole beside the River Pang in Berkshire, southern England. A 29 & nbsp;hectare extension to the nature reserve at Moor Copse Nature Reserve|Moor Copse, near Tidmarsh Berkshire, was acquired in January & nbsp;2007 by the Berks, Bucks, and Oxon Wildlife Trust.  .
