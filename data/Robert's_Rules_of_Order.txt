 ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'', commonly referred to as ''Robert's Rules of Order'', RONR, or simply ''Robert's Rules'', is the most widely used manual of parliamentary procedure in the United States.     It governs the meetings of a diverse range of organizations—including church groups, county commissions, homeowners associations, nonprofit associations, professional societies, school boards, and trade unions—that have adopted it as their parliamentary authority.  
 
 The manual was first published in 1876 by U.S. Army officer Henry Martyn Robert, who adapted the rules and practice of United States Congress|Congress to the needs of non-legislative societies. Ten subsequent editions have been published, including major revisions in 1915 and 1970. The copyright to ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'' is owned by the Robert's Rules Association, which selects by contract an authorship team to continue the task of revising and updating the book. The 12th and current edition was released on September 1, 2020.   Nonprofit Quarterly|language=en-US}}  
 
 In 2005, the Robert's Rules Association published an official concise guide, titled #In Brief|''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief''. A third edition of the brief book was published in 2020. 
 
 == History and origins == 
 File:Henry Martyn Robert.jpg|thumb|upright|Henry M. Robert 
 San Francisco in the mid-to-late 19th century was a chaotic place, with people of many nationalities and traditions thrown together. Meetings of any kind tended to be tumultuous, with little consistency of procedure. A U.S. Army officer, Henry Martyn Robert (1837–1923), saw a need for a standard of parliamentary procedure. The first edition of the book, whose full title was ''Pocket Manual of Rules of Order for Deliberative Assemblies'', was published in February 1876 by the then-Major Robert, with the short title ''Robert's Rules of Order'' placed on its cover.    
 
 The procedures prescribed by the book were loosely modeled after those used in the United States House of Representatives, with such adaptations as Robert saw fit for use in ordinary societies.     Although he was in the military, the rules in his book were not based on military rules. The author's interest in parliamentary procedure began in 1863 when he was chosen to preside over a church meeting and, although he accepted the task, he felt that he did not have the necessary knowledge of proper procedure.    
 
 In his later work as an active member of several organizations, Robert discovered that members from different areas of the country had very different views regarding what the proper parliamentary rules were, and these conflicting views hampered the organizations in their work.   He eventually became convinced of the need for a new manual on the subject, one which would enable many organizations to adopt the same set of rules.  
  
 
 == Official editions and other versions == 
 === Official editions === 
 
 Henry M. Robert himself published four editions of the manual before his death in 1923, the last being the thoroughly revised and expanded Fourth Edition published as ''Robert's Rules of Order Revised'' in May 1915.        By this time Robert had long been retired from the Army with the rank of brigadier general. The revisions were based on the feedback from hundreds of letters that Robert had received through the years.    In addition, to explain the rules in ''Robert's Rules of Order Revised'' (abbreviated ROR), Robert published an introductory book for beginners titled ''Parliamentary Practice: An Introduction to Parliamentary Law'' in 1921 and a full book of explanations titled ''Parliamentary Law'' in 1923.       
 
 Through a family trust, and later through the Robert's Rules Association (which is made up of descendants of Henry M. Robert), several subsequent editions of Robert's Rules of Order have been published, including another major revision of the work.           The Seventh Edition, published in February 1970 on the 94th anniversary of the publication of the First Edition, was the first under the title ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'' (RONR).        The subsequent editions were based on additional feedback from users, including feedback received by electronic means in recent years. These later editions included material from Robert's ''Parliamentary Practice'' and ''Parliamentary Law''.    
 
 The current edition of the series became effective on September 1, 2020 under the title ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'', Twelfth Edition.   Announcement by Henry M. Robert, III, at the 2011 convention of the National Association of Parliamentarians   This edition states that it: 
   }}The authorship team of the current Twelfth Edition consists of a grandson of General Robert, an attorney, a lobbyist and legislative analyst, a mathematics professor, and a copy editor, all of them being experienced Parliamentarian (consultant)|parliamentarians.       
 
 More than six million copies have been printed (which is a total of all editions).

 Henry M. Robert III, grandson of the original author and Trustee for the Robert's Rules Association, had acknowledged that  " there has been controversy among parliamentarians concerning the length of ''Robert's Rules'' in its various editions and the complexity of the rules it describes. "   As a result, a supplemental book was developed. 
 
 In 2005, a shorter reference guide, ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief'' (abbreviated RONRIB), was published by the same authorship team and publisher as the Tenth Edition of ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'' (RONR) and was made to be in accord with that edition of RONR. A third edition of this shorter guide was published in 2020 to conform with the current Twelfth Edition of ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised''. 
 
 The ''In Brief'' book is the only authorized concise guide for ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'' and is intended as an introductory book for those unfamiliar with parliamentary procedure.     The authors say,  " In only thirty minutes, the average reader can learn the bare essentials, and with about ninety minutes' reading can cover all the basics. "     It is meant to be an introductory supplement to the current edition of ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'' and is not suitable for adoption as a parliamentary authority in itself. 
 
 === Other variations === 
 Since the copyrights for several of the original editions (1915 or earlier) have expired, numerous other books and manuals have been published incorporating  " Robert's Rules of Order "  as part of their titles, with some of them based on those earlier editions (see List of books with Robert's Rules in the title). 
 
 The existence of multiple editions and other variations, all published as  " Robert's Rules of Order " , can sometimes cause confusion, as the various publications may differ in some details. For example:    
 *Robert's Rules of Order, The Modern Edition, revised (1996) by Darwin Patnode, PhD, past President of the American Institute of Parliamentarians. Simplified and updated based on the original 1876 edition 
 *Robert's Rules in Plain English, Second Edition (2009) by Doris P. Zimmerman 
 
 ==Explanation of purpose of book== 
 Generally, ''Robert's Rules of Order'' is a guide for conducting meetings and making decisions as a group. The purpose of the book is  " to enable assemblies of any size, with due regard for every member's opinion, to arrive at the general will on the maximum number of questions of varying complexity in a minimum amount of time and under all kinds of internal climate ranging from total harmony to hardened or impassioned division of opinion. "    
 
 The book is designed for use in Voluntary association|ordinary societies rather than Legislature|legislative assemblies, and it is the most commonly adopted parliamentary authority among societies in the United States.        It is also recognized as  " the most widely used reference for meeting procedure and business rules in the English-speaking world. "    
 
 The book states that it is  " a codification of the present-day general parliamentary law " .      " General parliamentary law "  refers to the common rules and customs for conducting business in organizations and assemblies. It does not refer to statutory legal requirements nor to common-law precedent derived from court judgments. In other words, the book is about procedures for meetings and not about what is  " legal "  (i.e. it is not a law book). 
 
 As a reference, it is designed to answer, as nearly as possible, any question of parliamentary procedure that may arise.   The Twelfth Edition contains 633 pages of text, and all of its original content was included because it  " has at some time come up as a question of procedure somewhere " .   The completeness of the book was made so that organizations would not have to write extensive rules for themselves. In addition, members of different organizations could refer to the same book of rules. 
 
 == Contents of current (12th) edition == 
 The contents of the current (12th) edition of ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'' (RONR), published in 2020, include details on the types of groups that use the book, the ways that decisions could be made, and the various situations in which decisions are made. 
 
 === The basics === 
 The Introduction in the book provides a history of parliamentary procedure and includes the background and history of Robert's Rules of Order. Rules in the book are based on the rights of the majority, of the minority (especially a strong minority that is greater than one third), of individual members, of absentees, and of all these together.     Some Principles of parliamentary procedure|fundamental principles upon which the book is based include: one question at a time; one person, one vote; and a vote being limited to members present.    
 
 A group that uses the book is called a deliberative assembly. The types of deliberative assemblies are a mass meeting, a local assembly of an organized society (local club or local branch), a Convention (meeting)|convention, a Legislature|legislative body, and a Board of directors|board.     An organization may have rules which could include a Articles of Incorporation|corporate charter, a constitution or By-law|bylaws, rules of order (special rules of order and parliamentary authority), standing rules, and customs. To conduct business, groups have meetings or Session (parliamentary procedure)|sessions that may be separated by more than or be within a quarterly time interval. The types of meetings are a regular meeting, a special meeting, an adjourned meeting, an Annual general meeting|annual meeting, an executive session, a public session, and Electronic voting|electronic meetings. 
 
 A member of a deliberative assembly has the right to attend meetings, make motions, speak in debate, and vote.     The process of making a decision is done through a Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion, which is a proposal to do something. The formal steps in handling a motion are the making of a motion, having a second, stating the motion, having Debate (parliamentary procedure)|debate on the motion, putting the motion to a vote, and announcing the results of the vote. Action could be taken informally without going through these steps by using unanimous consent.     When making a choice, the basic principle of decision is Majority#Majority vote|majority vote. In situations when more than majority vote is required, the requirement could include a Supermajority#Two-thirds vote|two-thirds vote, previous notice, or a vote of a Supermajority#Majority of the entire membership|majority of the entire membership. 
 
 === Motions === 
 The book provides details about main motions including the motion to Ratification|ratify. In addition, the book list of motions|lists other motions and provides details (including explanations, forms, and examples) on these motions which include: 
 * Subsidiary motions - postpone indefinitely, Amend (motion)|amend, Commit (motion)|commit or refer, postpone to a certain time, limit or extend limits of debate, previous question, and Table (parliamentary procedure)|lay on the table 
 * Privileged motions - call for the orders of the day, raise a question of privilege, Recess (motion)|recess, Adjourn (motion)|adjourn, and fix the time to which to adjourn 
 * Incidental motions - point of order, Appeal (motion)|appeal, Suspension of the rules|suspend the rules, objection to the consideration of a question, division of a question, consideration by paragraph or seriatim, motions relating to methods of voting and the polls, motions relating to nominations, request to be excused from a duty, and requests and inquiries (parliamentary inquiry, Request for information (parliamentary procedure)|request for information, Request for permission to withdraw or modify a motion|request for permission (or leave) to withdraw or modify a motion, request to read papers, and request for any other privilege) 
 * Motion that brings a question again before the assembly|Motions that bring a question again before an assembly - Table (parliamentary procedure)|take from the table, Rescind or amend something previously adopted|rescind/amend something previously adopted, discharge a committee, and Reconsideration of a motion|reconsider 
 Details for each motion include its purpose, when it could be made, if it is debatable, if it is amendable, the vote required for adoption, and if it could be reconsidered. The  " order of precedence " , or rank, of the motions is also described in detail. 
 
 === Various topics === 
 The second half of the book covers various topics in detail. Brief summaries of these topics are as follows: 
 
 Depending on the situation, motions could be Renewal (parliamentary procedure)|renewed, or made again. On the other hand, members should not use legitimate motions for Dilatory motions and tactics|dilatory and improper purposes to waste time. 
 
 A quorum, or minimum number of members, is required to be present at a meeting in order to validly conduct business. The business that is to come up in a meeting could be listed in an order of business or an Agenda (meeting)|agenda. 
 
 Each member could get a chance to speak through Recognition (parliamentary procedure)|assignment of the floor and Debate (parliamentary procedure)|debate. Debate may be limited in the number of speeches and time and should be respectful to others at all times. Voting takes place to decide the course of action and it could be done in a multitude of ways, such as Voting methods in deliberative assemblies|voice vote, standing vote, and ballot vote. 
 
 Officers in an organization could be elected through the process of nominations and elections. Each organization decides for itself which officers to have, but the minimum officers in a deliberative assembly are a presiding officer (usually  " President (corporate title)|president "  or  " chairman " ) and a secretary. The secretary keeps the minutes, or the official records of the proceedings, for each meeting. As part of their duties, the officers may have reports to give, such as a financial report given by the treasurer. In addition, an organization may have a Board of directors|board to handle business on behalf of the organization. Officers and boards only have such authority and powers that are given to them in the governing documents of the organization. There may also be committees that are formed to assist the organization. The boards and committees may have reports to give as well. 
 
 People may gather in mass meetings for a specific purpose or cause. One such purpose of the mass meetings could be for the intent of organizing a permanent society. 
 
 Each organization has its basic rules contained in its By-law|bylaws. The bylaws could describe the name of the organization and its purpose, the requirements to be a member or an officer, how meetings are scheduled, if there are boards or committees (or both), its parliamentary authority, and how to amend the bylaws. 
 
 Representatives from constituent groups may gather as delegates in Convention (meeting)|conventions to conduct business on behalf of the organization. Conventions may consist of several meetings and may last for several days or more on an annual basis or other such infrequent interval. 
 
 If members do not act according to the organization's rules, they could be subject to disciplinary procedures. Such action could range from censure to the extreme of expulsion from the organization. Officers could be disciplined by removal from office. 
 
 === Charts, tables, and lists === 
 The tinted pages (pages marked by a gray band along the outer edge) in the rear of the book contain the following charts, tables, and lists: (1) Chart for Determining When Each Subsidiary or Privileged Motion Is In Order, (2) Table of Rules Relating to Motions, (3) Sample Forms Used in Making Motions, (4) and (5) Motions and Parliamentary Steps, (6) Motions Which Require a Two-Thirds Vote, (7) Motions Whose Reconsideration Is Prohibited Or Limited, and (8) Table of Rules for Counting Election Ballots.    
 
 == Additional information related to current edition == 
 In addition to containing a summary of basic points from the current (12th) edition of ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'' (RONR), the following contents are unique to the current (3rd) edition of ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief'' (RONRIB)'':'' an example of an agenda, additional sample dialogues, frequently asked questions, an example of a call of a meeting, an example of a memorandum listing the order of business, and the following tables: (A) Handling Motions as Chair, (B) When Chair Stands and Sits, (C) Conducting a Meeting as Chair, (D) Table of Rules Relating to Motions, and (E) Words to Use as a Member.     
 
 The Robert's Rules Association has also made the Eleventh Edition available in CD-ROM format (designed for installation on Windows PCs) through American Legal Publishing. The CD contains the current editions of ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'' and ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief'' as well as a Timekeeper's Guide, Teller (elections)|Teller’s Report, Sample Rules for Electronic Meetings, various Forms, and resources for Ballot Voting and Understanding Second-degree amendment|Secondary Amendments.    
 
 For the first time, an e-book version of the current Twelfth Edition was released by the Robert's Rules Association. Any copy of Robert's Rules of Order that is downloaded online is likely an older edition (1915 or earlier) that is available in the public domain. 
 
 Translations of any edition of Robert's Rules of Order into other languages have not been published by the Robert's Rules Association.  On the [ official website], there is no mention of translated versions.   Any translated copy of Robert's Rules of Order done by a third party may not accurately reflect the correct meaning in the target language.    
 
 == Changes between editions == 
 The following table lists some of the changes that were made between the editions of Robert's Rules of Order.

 Generally, a fuller list and more details of the changes are found in the preface of each edition. A detailed list of changes for the current (12th) edition is provided on the website maintained by the Robert's Rules Association.     All the changes were a result of questions and comments received from users. 
 
 == Explanations of rules in book == 
 Starting in the period between the Tenth Edition and the Eleventh Edition, the authors released official interpretations of rules in the book onto the website maintained by the Robert's Rules Association.     The interpretations from that period were later incorporated into the Eleventh Edition.  
 
 In addition, the authors addressed common misunderstandings of the rules coming from frequently asked questions.     Some of the misunderstandings involve: when the president can vote, if Ex officio member|ex-officio members can vote, the definition of majority, how abstentions affect the vote, a  " friendly amendment " ,  " calling the question " ,  " tabling "  a motion, getting items on the agenda, and the contents of minutes. While these misunderstandings are of the rules in the current edition of ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'', the organization may be governed by other rules which supersede these  " default "  rules.  
 
 The official interpretations and addressed common misunderstandings were a result of questions posted in the Question  &  Answer Forum at the Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site.     This forum is actively Internet forum#Moderators|moderated by members of the authorship team. 
 
 == Application to specific organizations == 
 In those cases in which the bylaws or other governing documents of an organization refer to  " Robert's Rules of Order, "  certain rules in the book may be subordinate to other specified rules, including any conflicting provisions in applicable law, the corporate charter, the constitution or bylaws, and special rules of order. 
 
 === Types of organizations === 
 In the Question  &  Answer Forum on the website maintained by the Robert's Rules Association, members of the following types of organizations have posted questions regarding how the rules in the book apply to their specific organization:  
  
 
 === Law-making bodies === 
 Generally, ''Robert's Rules of Order'' is designed for Voluntary association|ordinary societies. However, law-making bodies at the local level (such as a city council or a county commission) function similarly to boards of societies.     The book has found application to such bodies. Such bodies are also subject to open meeting laws (Sunshine laws) and other applicable laws, all of which supersede any conflicting provisions in the book. 
 
 On the other hand, legislative bodies at the state or national level have their own well-defined set of rules (such as Mason's Manual of Legislative Procedure). However, a survey found that four state legislative chambers in the United States still use ''Robert's Rules of Order''.    
 
 ===Corporate world=== 
  
 ''Robert's Rules of Order'' is based on each member of a group having equal weight as expressed by vote.     This book has found application in the corporate world, such as in shareholder meetings and in board of director meetings.     However, the rules have to be modified to account for when some individuals within the group have more power than others. 
 
 === Parliamentarians === 
 A Parliamentarian (consultant)|parliamentarian is an expert on parliamentary procedure. To be effective consultants for the organizations they work for, parliamentarians are expected to be knowledgeable on ''Robert's Rules of Order''.     
 
 The National Association of Parliamentarians (NAP) is the largest non-profit association of parliamentarians in the world. This organization bases its opinions and instruction upon ''Robert’s Rules of Order Newly Revised'' (12th ed.).     Membership in this organization requires passing an exam which is based on the first half of the concise guide, ''Robert’s Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief'' (3rd ed.).    
 
 The American Institute of Parliamentarians is another non-profit association of parliamentarians. This organization stresses proficiency and familiarity with a variety of Parliamentary authority|parliamentary authorities, although it states on its website that  " ''Robert's Rules of Order'' is the most frequently used parliamentary authority " .     The website also states that it  " is the premier manual on parliamentary authority "  and  " a 'must-have' text for every parliamentarian " .    
 
 === Youth organizations === 
 Youth organizations, such as Business Professionals of America|Business Professionals of America (BPA), Family, Career and Community Leaders of America|Family, Career and Community Leaders of America (FCCLA), FBLA-PBL|Future Business Leaders of America-Phi Beta Lambda (FBLA-PBL), HOSA (organization)|HOSA-Future Health Professionals, the National FFA Organization, SkillsUSA, and the Technology Student Association (TSA), sponsor parliamentary procedure competitions (such as Parli Pro) as part of their programs for their student members. These competitions are based on ''Robert’s Rules of Order Newly Revised''. The National Association of Parliamentarians have partnered with some of these organizations.    
 
 ''Robert's Rules of Order'' are used in Congressional Debate (also referred to as Student congress|Student Congress), an event put on by the National Speech and Debate Association|National Speech and Debate Association (NSDA).    
 
 ''Robert's Rules of Order'' is also used during American Legion and American Legion Auxiliary Boys/Girls State programs and in Model United Nations conferences. While the chair of each committee in an MUN conference may sometimes deviate from the written rules for educational purposes, the format of the rules in the specific committees is mostly based on ''Robert's Rules of Order''.     Another program in which ''Robert's Rules of Order'' may be used is Model Congress, although the rules in these programs may more closely resemble those in the legislative assemblies that the programs simulate.       
 
 == Alternative rules for organizations == 
 
 === Organization-specific rules === 
 Even if an organization has adopted ''Robert's Rules of Order'', it can still adopt its own rules which supersede any rules in this book.     The only limitations might come from the rules in a parent organization or from national, state, or local law. An example of a rule that organizations sometimes adopt is one that allows the use of proxy voting. Such a rule is not allowed unless the organization specifically provides for it in its bylaws.    
 
 === Other parliamentary authorities === 
 Parliamentarians have estimated that about 85 to 95 percent of organizations in the United States use ''Robert's Rules of Order''.     The remaining percentage of organizations use other books on meeting procedures. Notable examples of such books on parliamentary authority include ''The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure'', ''Demeter's Manual of Parliamentary Law and Procedure'', and ''Riddick's Rules of Procedure''.   These books along with ''Robert's Rules of Order'' share the general idea of rule of the majority with respect for the minority. A difference may be a  " simplification "  of the rules. Henry M. Robert III responded to the simplification by saying the following:  
 
 Also in response to the simplification was the publication of a supplemental guide to the official book (see #In Brief|''In Brief''). 
 
 === Consensus decision-making === 
 In modern parliamentary procedure, the usual practice is having a proposal first, then discussion on this proposal with any modifications to it, and finally a vote on it, with majority vote deciding the issue if there are any disagreements. An alternative to this process is consensus decision-making. In this alternative, discussion of potential proposals is held first, followed by the framing of a proposal, and then modifying it until the group reaches a consensus, when there is no longer any disagreement. 
 
 As a response to this alternative, the authors of ''Robert's Rules of Order'' stated their belief in using debate and majority vote as part of the process in making decisions for the group.  :  " Robert saw, on the other hand, that the evolution of majority vote in tandem with lucid and clarifying debate—resulting in a decision representing the view of the deliberate majority—far more clearly ferrets out and demonstrates the will of an assembly. "
