 ==Overview== 
 The novel depicts a world in which genetic selection for increased health, longevity, and intelligence has become so widespread that the unmodified  " control group|control naturals "  are a carefully-managed and protected minority. Duels and the carrying of arms are socially accepted ways of maintaining civility in public. A man can wear distinctive clothing to show his unwillingness to duel, but that results in an inferior social status. The world has become an economic utopia; the  " economic dividend "  is so high that post-scarcity|work has become optional. The chief economic problem uses up the economic surplus: many high-quality goods actually cost ''less'' than those of lower quality. Many people use lower-quality goods as status symbols. The government invests heavily in scientific research, but it has the side effect of further increasing productivity a decade or more later and so long-term projects with no expected economic return are favored above anything but medical research, on the theory that longer lifespans will consume more surplus. 
 
 The story's protagonist, Hamilton Felix (surname first), is the archetypal Ã¼bermensch. He is the penultimate step in a  " star line "  designed to breed for the highest-quality human characteristics. However, he lacks eidetic memory, which disqualifies him for what many consider to be humanity's most important occupation: that of an  " encyclopedic synthesist, "  who analyzes the sum total of human knowledge for untapped potential. As such, he finds his life and the society in which he lives to be enjoyable but meaningless. However, when one of the synthesists seeks him out and inquires when he plans to continue his line, he finds himself drawn into an adventure that gives him purpose and also convinces him that his society is worth saving after all. 
 
 Major themes in the novel are reincarnation, the immortality of the soul, and telepathy. Felix is the product of generations of genetic engineering. He is almost but not quite the perfect human. In the second half of the book, his genetically-engineered son is born, the climax of generations of genetic engineering and selective breeding and a genetically-perfect human. As the son grows, he begins to develop almost-superhuman mental abilities and a surprising telepathic ability. 
 
 As the novel draws to a close, it becomes apparent that the son senses that Hamiton Felix's second child, a daughter, is the reincarnation of a wise elderly government official, who foresaw her own death and arranged to die shortly before Felix's daughter was born. The official understood that the soul is reincarnated, and in preparation for her own death and reincarnation, she was instrumental in the genetic engineering of the son and the daughter.
