 
 The ''New Oxford American Dictionary'' (''NOAD'') is a single-volume dictionary of American English compiled by American editors at the Oxford University Press. 
 
 ''NOAD'' is based upon the ''New Oxford Dictionary of English'' (''NODE''), published in the United Kingdom in 1998, although with substantial editing, additional entries, and the inclusion of illustrations.  It is based on a corpus linguistics analysis of Oxford's 200 million word database of contemporary American English. 
 
 ''NOAD'' includes a Pronunciation respelling for English|diacritical respelling scheme to convey pronunciations, as opposed to the Pronunciation respelling for English#International Phonetic Alphabet|Gimson phonemic IPA system that is used in ''NODE''.

 ==   Fictitious entry== 
 The dictionary includes an entry for the word  " esquivalience " , which it defines as meaning  " the willful avoidance of one's official responsibilities " .  This is a fictitious entry, intended to protect the copyright of the publication.  The entry was invented by Christine Lindberg, one of the editors of the ''NOAD''.    
 
 With the publication of the second edition, a rumor circulated that the dictionary contained a fictitious entry in the letter 'e'. ''The New Yorker|New Yorker'' contributing editor Henry Alford combed the section, and discussed several unusual entries he found with a group of American lexicographers. Most found  " esquivalience "  to be the most likely candidate, and when Alford approached ''NOAD'' editor in chief Erin McKean she confirmed it was a fake entry, which had been present since the first edition, in order to protect the copyright of the CD-ROM edition. Of the word, she said  " its inherent fakeitude is fairly obvious " .       
 
 The fake entry apparently ensnared Reference.com|dictionary.com, which included an entry for it (that has since been removed) which it attributed to ''Webster's New Millennium Dictionary'', both of which are owned by the private company Reference.com|Lexico.    Possibly due to its licensing of Oxford dictionaries, Google Dictionary included the word, listing three meanings and giving usage examples.
