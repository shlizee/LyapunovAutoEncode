 ==Details== 
 The book was published on the heels of ''The Shining (novel)|The Shining'' (1977 Doubleday) and was King's fifth published book (including ''Rage (Stephen King novel)|Rage'', which was published under the pseudonym of Richard Bachman). Nine of the twenty short stories in the book had first appeared in various issues of ''Cavalier (magazine)|Cavalier Magazine'' from 1970â€“1975; others were originally published in ''Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse'', ''Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan'', ''Gallery'', ''Ubris'', and ''Maine Magazine''. The stories  " Jerusalem's Lot " ,  " Quitters Inc. " ,  " The Last Rung on the Ladder " , and  " The Woman in the Room "  appeared for the first time in this collection. 
 
 ==Foreword and introduction== 
 ''Night Shift'' is the first book for which King wrote a foreword.  The introduction was written by one of King's favorite authors, John D. MacDonald. 
 
 ==Film, television or theatrical adaptations== 
 With the publication of ''Night Shift'' and the rise in King's popularity as a best-selling author, also with the success of Brian De Palma's motion picture adaptation of ''Carrie'' (1976), student film and theatre makers began to submit requests to King to make adaptations of the stories that appeared in the collection. King formed a policy he deemed the Dollar Baby|Dollar Deal, which allowed the students the permission to make an adaptation for the consideration of just $1. 
 
 In the 1980s, entrepreneurial film producer Milton Subotsky purchased the rights to six of the stories in this collection with the intention to produce feature films and a television anthology based on multiple stories. Although Subotsky was involved with several King adaptations (''Cat's Eye'', ''Maximum Overdrive'', ''Sometimes They Come Back'', ''The Lawnmower Man'') the television series never came to fruition due to conflicts with the networks' Broadcast Standards and Practices|Standards and Practices.  Perakos, Peter S.  " Stephen King on ''Carrie'', ''The Shining'', etc. "  published in ''Cinefantastique'' Magazine Vol 1 No 8 Winter 1978. Reprinted in  " Feast of Fear "  Underwood  &  Miller, Carroll and Graf 1989 pp. 70
