It is the sequel to the 1968 novel ''2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A & nbsp;Space Odyssey'', but continues the story of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|film adaptation with the same title rather than Clarke's original novel, which differed from the film in some respects. 
 
 Set in the year 2010, the plot centres on a joint Soviet-American mission aboard the Soviet spacecraft ''Alexei Leonov|The Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov''. The mission has several objectives, including salvaging the spaceship ''Discovery'' and investigating the Monolith (Space Odyssey)|mysterious  " monolith "  discovered by Space Odyssey#Characters|Dave Bowman in ''2001: A Space Odyssey''. It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1983.     The novel was adapted for the screen by Peter Hyams and released as a 2010 (film)|film in 1984. 
 
 ==Plot summary== 
 The story is set nine years after the failure of the ''Discovery One'' mission to Jupiter.  The novel version of ''2001'' featured the journey to Saturn instead: Clarke acknowledges this retcon|retroactive continuity in his author's foreword.  
 
 A joint Soviet-American crew,  The Soviet Union did not dissolve until nine years after this book was written.   including Heywood Floyd from ''2001'', on the Soviet Spacecraft|spaceship ''Alexei Leonov'' (named after the Alexei Leonov|cosmonaut) arrives to discover what went wrong with the earlier mission, to investigate the Monolith (Space Odyssey)|monolith in orbit around the planet, and to resolve the disappearance of David Bowman (Space Odyssey)|David Bowman. They hypothesize that much of this information is locked away on the now-abandoned ''Discovery One''. The Soviets have an advanced new  " Andrei Sakharov|Sakharov "  drive which will propel them to Jupiter ahead of the American ''Discovery Two'', so Floyd is assigned to the ''Leonov'' crew. 
 
 However, a Chinese space program|Chinese space station rockets out of Earth orbit, revealing itself to be the interplanetary spacecraft ''Tsien Hsue-shen|Tsien'', also aimed at Jupiter. The ''Leonov'' crewmembers think the Chinese are on a one-way trip due to its speed, but Floyd surmises that due to the large water content of Europa (moon)|Europa they intend to land there and use the water content to refuel. The ''Tsien''  '  s daring mission ends in failure, when it is destroyed by an indigenous life-form on Europa. The only survivor, Professor Chang, radios the story to the ''Leonov''; it is presumed that he dies when his spacesuit air supply runs out. 
 
 The ''Leonov'' survives a dangerous aerobraking around Jupiter and arrives at ''Discovery''. Mission crewmember and HAL 9000's creator, Dr. Chandra, reactivates the computer to ascertain the cause of his earlier aberrant behaviour. After some time, Floyd is speaking to Vasili Orlov on board, and Orlov, for an instant, sees the Monolith dubbed 'Big Brother' open again, into a Stargate, as David Bowman escapes from the Monolith's dimension back into ours. (Dr. Floyd is unfortunately facing the wrong direction and does not see this.) 
 
 A sequence of scenes follows the explorations of David Bowman, who has been transformed into a non-Matter|corporeal, energy-based life-form, much like the aliens controlling the monoliths. During his journey, the avatar of Bowman appears on Earth, making contact with significant individuals from his past: He visits his mother and brushes her hair (shortly before she dies), and he appears to his ex-girlfriend on her television screen.  The aliens are using Bowman as a probe to learn about humankind. He then returns to the Jupiter system to explore beneath the ice of Europa, where he finds aquatic life-forms, and under the clouds of Jupiter, where he discovers gaseous life-forms. Both are wikt:primitive|primitive, but the aliens deem the Europan creatures to have evolutionary potential. 
 
 An apparition of Bowman appears before Floyd, warning him that they must leave Jupiter within fifteen days. Floyd has difficulty convincing the rest of the crew at first, but then the monolith vanishes from orbit. 
 
 The ''Leonov'' crew devises a plan to use the ''Discovery'' as a  " Booster (rocketry)|booster rocket " , enabling them to return to Earth ahead of schedule. HAL and the ''Discovery'' will be trapped in Jupiter's orbit, with insufficient fuel to escape. The crew are worried that HAL will have the same neurosis on discovering that he will be abandoned yet again, so Chandra must convince HAL that the human crew is in danger. 
 
 The ''Leonov'' crew flees Jupiter as a mysterious dark spot appears on Jupiter and begins to grow. HAL's telescope observations reveal that the  " Great Black Spot "  is, in fact, a vast population of monoliths, increasing at an exponential rate, which appear to be eating the planet. By acting as self-replicating machines, these monoliths increase Jupiter's density until the planet achieves nuclear fusion, becoming a small star. This obliterates the primitive life forms inhabiting the Jovian atmosphere, which the Monoliths' controllers had deemed highly unlikely to ever achieve intelligence, unlike the aquatic life of Europa. 
 
 As Jupiter is about to transform, Bowman returns to ''Discovery'' to give HAL a last order to carry out. HAL begins repeatedly broadcasting the message 
 
  
 
 The creation of the new star, which Earth eventually names Lucifer, destroys ''Discovery''. However, in appreciation for HAL's help, Bowman has the aliens which control the monoliths remove HAL's artificial intelligence from ''Discoverys computer core and transform him into the same kind of life form as David Bowman, and become his companion. 
 
 ===Epilogue=== 
 The book ends with a brief epilogue, which takes place in AD 20,001. By this time, the Europa (moon)|Europans have evolved into a species that has developed a primitive civilisation, most likely with assistance from a monolith. They are not described in detail, though they are said to have  " tendril " -like limbs. They regard the star Lucifer (formerly the planet Jupiter) as their primary sun, referring to Sol as  " The Cold Sun " . Though their settlements are concentrated primarily in the hemisphere of Europa which is constantly bathed in Lucifer's rays, some Europans have begun in recent generations to explore the Farside, the hemisphere facing away from Lucifer, which is still covered in ice. There they may witness the spectacle of night, unknown on the other side of Europa, when the Cold Sun sets. 
 
 The Europans who explore the Farside have been carefully observing the night sky and have begun to develop a mythology based on their observations. They correctly believe that Lucifer was not always there. They believe that the Cold Sun was its brother and was condemned to march around the sky for a crime. The Europans also see three other major bodies in the sky. One seems to be constantly engulfed in fire, and the other two have lights on them which are gradually spreading. These three bodies are the moons Io (moon)|Io, Callisto (moon)|Callisto, and Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede, the latter two of which are presently being colonised by humans. 
 
 Humans have been attempting to explore Europa ever since Lucifer was created in 2010. However, none of these attempts has been successful. Every probe that has attempted to land on Europa has been destroyed on approach. The debris from every probe falls to the surface of the planet, and the debris from some of the first ships to be destroyed is Cargo Cult|venerated by the Europans. 
 
 Finally, there is a Monolith on the planet, which is worshipped by the Europans more than anything else. The Europans assume, correctly, that the Monolith is what keeps humans at bay. Dave Bowman and HAL lie dormant in this Monolith. The Monolith is the guardian of Europa, and will continue to prevent contact between humans and Europans for as long as it sees fit. 
 
 ==Characters== 
 ===Main characters=== 
 
 In the novel, the ''Leonov'' is staffed by three Americans, and seven Soviets. HAL also re-appears as a major character. 
 
 * Dr. Heywood Floyd: The protagonist, Floyd must embark on an odyssey to Jupiter with American colleagues aboard a Soviet ship, the ''Leonov'', to revive ''Discovery''. 
 * Dr. Walter Curnow: gregarious American engineer and expert on ''Discovery's'' systems. Curnow is bisexual; a vision of Clarke's LGBTQ-friendly sci-fi future. He develops a friendship (which Floyd alludes to as more than friendship) with the ''Leonov's''  " Max " , Dr. Maxim Brailovsky, though both characters eventually become engaged to women. 
 * Dr. Sivasubramanian Chandrasegarampillai, or  " Dr. Chandra " : HAL's inventor. Quiet and reserved, Dr. Chandra is the third American team member, charged with re-activating HAL. For the 1984 film, the character was changed to an American played by Bob Balaban. 
 * Captain Tatiana  " Tanya "  Orlova: Soviet captain of the ''Leonov''. The character's last name in the film was changed to Kirbuk and was played by British actress Helen Mirren. 
 * Dr. Vasili Orlov: the ''Leonov's'' chief scientist, and husband of Orlova. 
 * Dr. Maxim (Max) Brailovsky: Spacewalker and Curnow's Soviet counterpart. He and Curnow are both bisexual and enjoy a romantic relationship during the mission, though Max eventually becomes engaged to Zenia Marchenko. 
 * Surgeon Commander Katerina Rudenko: The ''Leonov's'' matronly medical doctor. In the film, this character is recast as a male. 
 * Dr. Alexander  " Sasha "  Kovalev: a minor character among the ''Leonov's'' crew, Sasha states basic science information at certain points. 
 * Dr. Nikolai Ternovsky: A minor character among the ''Leonov's'' crew, Ternovsky works with Dr. Chandra to reactivate HAL upon the ''Discovery'' rendezvous. 
 * Zenia Marchenko: an understudy for Dr. Irina Yakunina, ship's nutritionist. In the book, Marchenko shelters with Floyd while the ''Leonov'' executes a dangerous and dramatic maneuver. The film's equivalent character, who likewise shelters with Floyd, is there named as ''Irina Yakunina'', the same namesake as the book's replaced character, who in the book does not actually join the ''Leonov's'' voyage, due to a hang gliding accident. 
 * HAL 9000: the ''Discovery's'' on board ship's computer, HAL is held suspect by most other characters for having caused the deaths of the ''Discovery's'' crew, with the exception of Bowman. This, despite the explanation that HAL was given conflicting orders regarding secrecy and deception, which HAL is manifestly designed not to carry out. 
 
 ===Minor characters=== 
 
 * The Floyd Family: Floyd is described as having had two families. Floyd's deceased first wife, Marion, is said to have borne him two daughters. At the time of the novel's events, Floyd is living with his second wife, Caroline, and their son Christopher, a toddler. A male dolphin named Scarback, together with its mate, routinely visit the Floyd household, and communicates with Christopher in a language dubbed Dolphin. 
 * The Bowman Family: In a series of flashbacks and literal movements through space and time, the newly-ascended character of David Bowman remembers, interacts with, and makes some peace with his old human life. Bowman remembers his brother Robert  " Bobby "  Bowman, who died while the two used an improvised scuba device to explore an underwater cave as children, and Bowman visits his elderly mother Jessie Bowman in her hospital room at the moment of her death. Later, Bowman also visits his ex-girlfriend Betty Fernandez (née Schultz). In youth, Betty had originally been Robert's girlfriend, and after Robert's death, Betty took up with Bowman. Following Bowman's disappearance and presumptive death, Betty married Jose Fernandez, and bore him a son, Carlos. In their final interaction, Betty lies to Bowman that Carlos is his son. 
 * Professor Chang: One of five Chinese ''Tsien'' crew members (alongside one Dr. Lee, mentioned in passing), Chang relays a poignant farewell message to the ''Leonov'' from the surface of Europa, addressed especially to Floyd. In it, Chang reports the destruction of the ''Tsien'', his own imminent death, and the existence of life on Europa. The novel's early ''Tsien'' story arc, continued in ''2061'', in which Chinese astronauts compete with Americans and Soviets to be the first to rendezvous with ''Discovery'', is completely absent from the film. 
 * Dr. Dimitri Moisevitch: Floyd's Soviet friend and counterpart from the 2001 novel returns to correspond during the novel and give worldly  " spy-ripostes "  from one bureaucrat to another. In the novel's opening scene, Moisevitch and Floyd present the exposition of the joint Soviet-American mission, against the backdrop of the Arecibo telescope; the film approximates this opening scene, instead using the Very Large Array as its setting. 
 * Victor Millson: Floyd's bureaucratic successor, rival and contact for official Earth/American business. 
 * SAL 9000: HAL's earthbound counterpart. An early scene shows Dr. Chandra discussing HAL with SAL, which is faithfully reproduced in the film. In the film, actress Candice Bergen provided the voice of SAL, which was credited to her as  " Olga Mallsnerd, " 
 
 ==Writing== 
 ''2010'' is Clarke's first book written on a computer. He wrote the first 25% of the novel on an electric typewriter, but started using an Archives III computer (made in Davenport, Iowa) in late 1981 (which he lovingly christened  " Archie " ). Impressed by its word processing features, he wrote the rest of the novel using this method.  Arthur C. Clarke and Peter Hyams. [ & dq=The+odyssey+file The Odyssey File]. Ballantine Books, 1984.  
 
 ===Relations to reality=== 
 Clarke used for the novel names of various Soviet dissidents, including physicists Andrei Sakharov and Yuri Orlov, human-rights activists Mykola Rudenko and Anatoly Marchenko, Russian Orthodox activist Gleb Yakunin.     Clarke himself makes a reference to  " getting (editor Vasili Zakharchenko) into deep trouble by borrowing the names of various dissidents "  in ''2061: Odyssey Three''.

 ===Discontinuities between ''2010'' and the other works=== 
 Clarke acknowledged such inconsistencies in the Author's Note to ''2061'':  Clarke, Arthur C. ''2061: Odyssey Three''. New York: Ballantine Books, 1988. Page ix  
  
 
 * In the film ''2001,'' the final spoken words are a recording of mission overviews. However, in the novel, during his encounter with the monolith, Dave Bowman says,  " Oh my God--it's full of stars! "  This quote (abbreviated to  " My God--it's full of stars! " ) is used in both the novel and the filmed version of ''2010.'' 
 * The second half of the novel ''2001: A Space Odyssey ''takes place around Saturn, with the Monolith embedded in the surface of the Saturnian moon Iapetus. The novel ''2010'' follows the continuity of the film ''2001'', which places the Monolith and ''Discovery'' in orbit between Jupiter and the Jovian moon Io. 
 * When Bowman recalls the events of ''2001'', he remembers the incident of chasing after Frank Poole's corpse in a pod without his helmet, and then entering the ''Discovery'' through the emergency airlock. This incident only occurred in the film. In the novel, HAL opens all of the pod bay doors and the emergency airlock to kill the crew when Bowman attempts to awaken them from hibernation. 
 * In all of the ''Space Odyssey'' novels and the film version of ''2010'', HAL's instructor is named Dr. Chandra; in the film ''2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey'', it is Mr. Langley.       
 * The events of ''3001'' make the epilogue of this novel impossible, or at least unlikely: the monoliths become infected with a series of computer viruses (through software emulation) and disappear from the Solar System. It is feasible, though, that the monolith network is able to purge itself of the viruses and return to Sol and Lucifer prior to the year 20,001, and avoid another human-sourced infection.

 ==Reception== 
 David Langford|Dave Langford reviewed ''2010: Odyssey Two'' for ''White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf'' #39, and stated that  " Since the strength of ''2001s mystical ending came from the teasing unanswerability of the question 'what happens next?' it's anticlimactic when Clarke now ''tells'' us what happens next. And though interesting things happen, smoothly described, there's a certain familiarity when the book halts on the brink of another and less interesting question. "
