 The book explains Jaynes's theory of the origin of consciousness (as he carefully and more narrowly defines it) based on metaphorical language in ancient history, and a previous mentality he called  " the bicameral mind. "  It was first published in English in 1976 (appearing on shelves in January 1977). The book was a nominee for the National Book Award in 1978. It received many positive book reviews, including those by well-known critics such as John Updike in ''The New Yorker'', Christopher Lehmann-Haupt in the ''New York Times'', and Marshall McLuhan in the Toronto ''Globe and Mail''. Articles on Jaynes and his ideas appeared in ''Time''     magazine and ''Psychology Today''     in 1977, and in ''Quest/78''     in 1978. Jaynes later expanded on the ideas in his book in a series of commentaries in the journal ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', in lectures and discussions published in ''Canadian Psychology'',     and in ''Art/World''. More than 40 years later, the book is still in print. 
 
 ==Jaynes's theories== 
 In his book, Jaynes reviews what one of his early critics acknowledged as the “spectacular history of failure”  Jones, William Thomas (1979) Mr. Jaynes and the bicameral mind: a case study in the sociology of belief. Humanities Working Paper, 23. California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA.     to explain consciousness – “the human ability to introspect”.     Abandoning the assumption that consciousness is innate, Jaynes explains it instead as a learned behavior that “arises & nbsp;... from language, and specifically from metaphor.”   With this understanding, Jaynes then demonstrated that ancient texts and archeology can reveal a history of human mentality alongside the histories of other cultural products. His analysis of the evidence led him not only to place the origin of consciousness during the 2nd millennium BCE but also to hypothesize the existence of an older non-conscious “mentality that he called the wikt:bicameral mind|bicameral mind, referring to the brain’s two hemispheres”.    
 
 Jaynes wrote an extensive afterword for the 1990 edition of his book, in which he addressed criticisms and clarified that his theory has four separate hypotheses: consciousness is based on and accessed by language; the non-conscious bicameral mind is based on verbal hallucinations; the breakdown of bicameral mind precedes consciousness, but the dating is variable; the 'double brain' of bicamerality is not today's functional lateralization of the cerebral hemispheres. He also expanded on the impact of consciousness on imagination and memory, notions of The Self, emotions, anxiety, guilt, and sexuality. 
 
 ==Reception and influence== 
 ''The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind'' was a successful work of popular science, selling out the first print run before a second could replace it. The book was a nominee for the National Book Award in 1978, and received dozens of positive book reviews, including those by well-known critics such as John Updike in ''The New Yorker'', Christopher Lehmann-Haupt in the ''New York Times'', and Marshall McLuhan in the Toronto ''Globe and Mail''. Articles on Jaynes and his ideas appeared in ''Time''   magazine and ''Psychology Today''   in 1977, and in ''Quest/78''   in 1978. Jaynes later expanded on the ideas in his book in a series of commentaries in the journal ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', in lectures and discussions published in ''Canadian Psychology'',   and in ''Art/World''. More than 40 years later, the book is still in print. It is mentioned in Richard Dawkins's 2006 work ''The God Delusion'' as  " one of those books that is either complete rubbish or a work of consummate genius, nothing in between! Probably the former, but I'm hedging my bets. " 
 
 Jaynes's work on consciousness has influenced philosophers Daniel Dennett,     Susan Blackmore, and Ken Wilber, and the bicameral model of the cerebral hemispheres has influenced schizophrenia researchers Henry Nasrallah     and Tim Crow.    
 
 The theory of bicamerality has been cited in thousands of books and articles, both scientific and popular.     It inspired early investigations of auditory hallucination by psychologist Thomas Posey     and clinical psychologist John Hamilton.     With further research in the late 1990s using new brain imaging technology, Jaynes's ideas received renewed attention        and recognition for contributing to a rethinking of auditory hallucinations and mental illness.    
 
 In the popular domain, the idea of bicamerality has influenced novelists Philip K. Dick,     William S. Burroughs,  Burroughs, William S.  " Sects and Death. "  ''Three Fisted Tales of Bob''. Ed. Rev. Ivan Stang. Fireside, 1990.    Neal Stephenson     and Robert J. Sawyer.     In 2009, American novelist Terence Hawkins published ''The Rage of Achilles'', a re-telling of Homer's Iliad|''The Iliad'' that imagines the hero's transition from bicameral mentality to consciousness. In ''The Psychology of Westworld: When Machines Go Mad'', Brian J. McVeigh analyzed how bicamerality was interpreted in the 2016 science fiction TV series Westworld (TV series)|''Westworld''.

 ===Scholarly commentary=== 
 “''The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind'' is one of those lush, overambitious books … that readers, on finishing it, find that they think about the world quite differently.” — Tanya Luhrmann, Ph.D., Professor of Anthropology, Stanford University, in “What Book Changed Your Mind?,” Chronicle of Higher Education 
 
 “[Jaynes] has one of the clearest and most perspicuous defenses of the top-down approach [to consciousness] that I have ever come across.” — Daniel Dennett, Ph.D., Professor of Philosophy, Tufts University, in ''Brainchildren'' 
 
 " Julian Jaynes’s theories for the nature of self-awareness, introspection, and consciousness have replaced the assumption of their almost ethereal uniqueness with explanations that could initiate the next change in paradigm for human thought.” — Michael A. Persinger, Ph.D., Professor of Behavioral Neuroscience, Laurentian University, in ''Reflections on the Dawn of Consciousness'' 
 
 " [Jaynes'] proposal is too interesting to ignore. "  — David Eagleman, in ''Incognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain'' 
 
 ===Controversy and criticism=== 
 In general, Jaynes is respected as a lecturer and a historian of psychology. Marcel Kuijsten, founder of the Julian Jaynes Society, asks why, in the decades after the book's publication,  " there have been few in-depth discussions, either positive or negative " , rejecting as too simplistic the criticism that  " Jaynes was wrong. "  
 
 Jaynes described the range of responses to his book as “from people who feel [the ideas are] very important all the way to very strong hostility. & nbsp;... When someone comes along and says consciousness is in history, it can’t be accepted. If [psychologists] did accept it, they wouldn’t have the motivation to go back into the laboratory & nbsp;...”  
 
 W. T. Jones, a sociologist who has been described as  " one of Jaynes's most thoroughgoing critics " , asked in 1979,  " Why, despite its implausibility, is [Jaynes's] book taken seriously by thoughtful and intelligent people? "   Jones agreed with Jaynes that  " the language in which talk about consciousness is conducted is metaphorical " , but he contradicted the basis of Jaynes's argument – that metaphor creates consciousness – by asserting that  " language (and specifically metaphor) does not create, it discovers, the similarities that language marks " . Jones also argued that three  " cosmological orientations "  biased Jaynes’s thinking: 1)  " hostility to Darwin "  and natural selection; 2) a  " longing for 'lost bicamerality' "  (Jones accused Jaynes of holding that  " we would all be better off if 'everyone' were once again schizophrenic " ); 3) a  " desire for a sweeping, all-inclusive formula that explains everything that has happened " . Jones concluded that  " ... those who share these biases & nbsp;... are likely to find the book convincing; those who do not will reject [Jaynes's] arguments & nbsp;... "  
 
 The neurological model in ''The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind'' was a radical neuroscience|neuroscientific hypothesis that was based on research novel at the time.  Today, his hypotheses are still controversial to many in the field. However, the more general idea of a  " divided self "  has found support from psychological and neurological studies, and many of the historical arguments made in the book remain intriguing, if not proven.    
 
 An early criticism by philosopher Ned Block argued that Jaynes had confused the emergence of consciousness with the emergence of the concept of consciousness. In other words, according to Block, humans were conscious all along but did not have the concept of consciousness and thus did not discuss it in their texts. Daniel Dennett countered that for some things, such as money, baseball, or consciousness, one cannot have the thing without also having the concept of the thing.  Daniel Dennett, op. cit., at pp. 127–128 in ''Brainstorms''   Moreover, it is arguable that Block misinterpreted the nature of what Jaynes claimed to be a social construction.
