 ''Bored of the Rings'' is a parody of J. R. R. Tolkien's ''The Lord of the Rings''. This short novel was written by Henry Beard and Douglas Kenney, who later founded ''National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon''. It was published in 1969 by New American Library|Signet for the ''Harvard Lampoon''.  In 2013, an audio version was produced by Orion Audiobooks, narrated by Rupert Degas. 
 
 ==Overview== 
 
 The parody closely follows the outline of ''The Lord of the Rings'', lampooning the prologue and map of Middle-earth; its main text is a short satirical summary of Tolkien's plot. The witty text combines slapstick humour and deliberately inappropriate use of brand names.     For example, the carbonated beverages ''Moxie'' and ''Pepsi'' replace ''Merry'' and ''Pippin''. Tom Bombadil appears as  " Timothy Leary|Tim Benzedrine " , a stereotypical hippie married to  " Hashberry " ,     a reference to Haight-Ashbury,  ''Bored of the Rings'', 2012 Touchstone edition, footnote to page 28.   a district of San Francisco nicknamed Hashish|Hashbury for its hippie counterculture at that time.     Other characters include Dildo Bugger of Bug End and Frito Bugger (Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo and Frodo Baggins), Goddam (Gollum), and Arrowroot, son of The Arrow Collar Man|Arrowshirt (Aragorn, son of Arathorn).   |journal=Mythlore |date=2000 |volume=22 |issue=4 (86) |pages=13-37}}        
 
 The book includes: 
 
 * A laudatory back cover review, written at Harvard, possibly by the authors themselves. 
 * Inside cover reviews which are entirely contrived, concluding with a quotation by someone affiliated with the publication ''Our Loosely Enforced Libel Laws''. 
 * A list of other books in the  " series " , none of which exists. 
 * A double-page map which has almost nothing to do with the events in the text. 
 * The first text a browsing reader is liable to see purports to be a salacious sample from the book, but the episode never happens in the main text, nor does anything else of that tone; the book has no explicit sexual content. 
 
 ==Reception== 
  
 
 The Tolkien critic David Bratman, writing in ''Mythlore'', quotes an extended passage from the book in which Frito, Spam (food)|Spam Gangree (Sam Gamgee), and Goddam jostle on the edge of the  " Black Hole "  (a tar pit), commenting  " Those parodists wrought better than they knew " , explaining that Tolkien, in his many drafts, came very close to  " inadvertently writing the parody version of his own novel " .    
 
 The author Mike Sacks, quoting the book's opening lines, writes that the book has had the distinction, rare for a parody, of being continuously in print for over 40 years, was one of the earliest parodies of  " a modern, popular bestseller " , and has inspired many pop culture writers including those who worked on ''Saturday Night Live'' and ''The Onion''.
