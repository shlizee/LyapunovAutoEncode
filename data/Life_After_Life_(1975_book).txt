It is a report on a qualitative study in which Moody interviewed 150 people who had undergone near-death experiences (NDEs). The book presents the author's composite account of what it is like to die.  Clifton D. Bryant (2003). [ & pg=PA138 Handbook of Death and Dying] Sage, p.138.   Michael Marsh. [ Review: Beyond Death: The Rebirth of Immortality] ''The Hastings Center Report'', Vol. 7, No. 5 (Oct., 1977), pp. 40–42.   On the basis of his collection of cases, Moody identified a common set of elements in NDEs:  
  
 *(a) an overwhelming feeling of peace and well-being, including freedom from pain. 
 *(b) the impression of being located outside one's physical body. 
 *(c) floating or drifting through darkness, sometimes described as a tunnel. 
 *(d) becoming aware of a golden light. 
 *(e) encountering and perhaps communicating with a  " being of light " . 
 *(f) having a rapid succession of visual images of one's past. 
 *(g) experiencing another world of much beauty.  Harvey J. Irwin and Caroline Watt. [ & dq=attacks+on+parapsychology & source=gbs_navlinks_s An introduction to parapsychology] McFarland, 2007, p. 159.

 ==Reception== 
 Moody's alleged evidence for an afterlife was heavily criticized as flawed, both logically and empirically.  Barry Beyerstein. (1990). ''Evaluating the Anomalous Experience''. In Kendrick Frazier. ''The Hundredth Monkey and Other Paradigms of the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. pp. 43–53.    The psychologist James Alcock has noted that  " [Moody] appears to ignore a great deal of the scientific literature dealing with hallucinatory experiences in general, just as he quickly glosses over the very real limitations of his research method. "  James Alcock. (1981). ''Psychology and Near-Death Experiences''. In Kendrick Frazier. ''Paranormal Borderlands of Science''. Prometheus Books. pp. 153–169.   
 
 The philosopher Paul Kurtz has written that Moody's evidence for the NDE is based on personal interviews and anecdotal accounts and there has been no statistical analyses of his data. According to Kurtz  " there is no reliable evidence that people who report such experiences have died and returned, or that consciousness exists separate from the brain or body. "  Paul Kurtz. (1991). ''Toward a New Enlightenment: The Philosophy of Paul Kurtz''. Transaction Publishers. p. 349.
