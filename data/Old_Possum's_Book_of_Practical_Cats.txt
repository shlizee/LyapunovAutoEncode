 ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'' (1939) is a collection of whimsical Light poetry|light poems by T. S. Eliot about Cat|feline psychology and sociology, published by Faber and Faber. It serves as the basis for Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1981 musical ''Cats (musical)|Cats''. 
 
 Eliot wrote the poems in the 1930s, and included them, under his assumed name  " Old Possum " , in letters to his godchildren. They were collected and published in 1939, with cover illustrations by the author, and quickly re-published in 1940, illustrated in full by Nicolas Bentley. They have also been published in versions illustrated by Edward Gorey (1982), Axel Scheffler (2009) and Rebecca Ashdown (2014).

 In 1954, English composer Alan Rawsthorne set six of the poems in a work for speaker and orchestra entitled ''Practical Cats'', which was recorded soon afterwards, with the actor Robert Donat as the speaker.  At about the same time another English composer, Humphrey Searle, composed another narrated piece based on the poems, using flute, piccolo, cello and guitar. This work, ''Two Practical Cats'', consists of settings of the poems about Macavity and Growltiger. 
 
 The best-known musical adaptation of the poems is Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical ''Cats (musical)|Cats'', which was premiered in the West End of London in 1981 and on Broadway in 1982.
