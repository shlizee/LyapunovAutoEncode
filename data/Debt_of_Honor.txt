 ==Plot summary== 
 Japanese industrialist Raizo Yamata has been plotting to bring back his country to a position of greatness for years, partly as revenge for the death of his family at the hands of American forces Battle of Saipan|invading the island of Saipan during World War II. His opportunity comes when a car accident in eastern Tennessee, caused by faulty gas tanks made in Japan, results in the deaths of six American people. The incident leads to the swift passage of a law allowing the U.S. to mirror trade practices of the countries from which it imports goods, cutting off the American export markets upon which the Japanese economy depends. Facing an economic crisis, Japan’s ruling zaibatsu, led by Yamata, decides to take economic and military action against the United States. Along with covert support from China and India, they plot to curtail the U.S. presence in the Pacific and re-establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. After the Prime Minister of Japan|Japanese Prime Minister Mogataru Koga resigns in disgrace due to the economic situation, the zaibatsu installs Hiroshi Goto, an aggressive nationalist and critic of the U.S., to succeed him. Meanwhile, Japan has covertly developed nuclear weapons, and with SS-18 missile|SS-18 designs bought from the former Soviet Union, has fabricated and deployed several Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBMs. 
 
 Japan launches the first phase of its assault, sending Japan Self-Defense Forces|Self-Defense Force units to occupy the Northern Mariana Islands|Mariana Islands, specifically Saipan and Guam, without casualties. However, during a joint military exercise, Japanese ships  " accidentally "  launch torpedoes at the United States Pacific Fleet|U.S. Pacific Fleet, destroying two submarines and crippling two aircraft carriers. An immediate retaliation is forestalled by the second phase of the Japanese offensive: an Economic warfare|economic attack, where Japan engineers the collapse of the U.S. stock market by hiring a programmer who is a consultant for an exchange firm to insert a logic bomb into the system, which when triggered blocks the storage of all trade records made after noon on Friday. They also assassinate the Chair of the Federal Reserve|chairman of the Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve. The Japanese government then immediately suing for peace|sue for peace, offering international talks and seemingly free elections in the Marianas to delay a U.S. response. 
 
 Meanwhile, Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan is pulled out of retirement from government service by U.S. President Roger Durling, who appoints him as National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor. Despite his typical focus on military issues, he advises the president to deal with the economic crisis first, realizing that Japan's deletion of trade records could be an advantage in responding to the economic threat. He engineers a  " do-over " , where all of the transactions that were deleted on the day of the mass deletion are ignored and all trade information is restored to its condition at noon of that day. The U.S. stock market is successfully restored with only minor disruption, and a group of U.S. Investment banking|investment banks start a massive economic unloading of Japanese investment products, effectively eliminating any gains made by the zaibatsu. 
 
 The United States military then proceeds to launch a counterattack on their Japanese counterparts using whatever resources they have. In a staged accident, Central Intelligence Agency|CIA operatives John Clark (Tom Clancy character)|John Clark and Domingo Chavez blind two incoming Japanese Boeing E-767|E-767 pilots with a Dazzler (weapon)|Dazzler that causes them to crash upon landing. The United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force then proceeds to eliminate the rest of Japan's Airborne early warning and control|AWACS system through low-profile military attacks using widely dispersed U.S. assets, allowing Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 bombers to destroy the hidden ICBM silos. They later use an attack by stealthy Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor|F-22 fighters to further damage Japan's air defenses. An Special Forces (United States Army)|Army special operations team is airdropped into Japan to support covertly inserted Boeing–Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche|Comanche helicopters.  One helicopter is used to attack another AWACS plane with air-to-air missiles while several others use AGM-114 Hellfire|Hellfire missiles to kill members of Yamata's cabal. Meanwhile, Admiral Robby Jackson liberates the Marianas with few casualties by using a combination of cruise missiles and carrier air attacks to severely damage the Japanese aircraft stationed on the islands, which forces the Japanese commander to surrender his troops. 
 
 Outmaneuvered and cornered by the United States's military and economic response, Goto resigns, ceding power to his predecessor Koga, who was rescued earlier by Clark and Chavez from Yamata. Yamata and his surviving conspirators are arrested for treason, and the new Japanese government accepts the generous U.S. offer of ''Status quo ante bellum|status quo ante''. 
 
 Throughout the book, President Durling faces another political crisis: Vice President of the United States|Vice President Ed Kealty is forced to resign after being accused of rape. With the crisis over, President Durling nominates Ryan as vice president for successfully handling the crisis. However, an embittered Japan Air Lines pilot, driven mad by the deaths of his son and brother during the conflict, flies his Boeing 747 directly into the United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol during a special Joint session of the United States Congress|joint session of Congress. The president, as well as nearly the entire Congress, the Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court, and many other members of the Federal government of the United States|federal government are killed in the attack. Ryan, who is on his way to be sworn as vice president after being confirmed, narrowly escapes the explosion. He becomes the President of the United States and takes his oath of office before a district judge in the CNN studios in Washington.

 ==Themes== 
 ''Debt of Honor'' was released during a time of American resentment towards the Japanese, which was further popularized by the publication of Michael Crichton's crime thriller novel ''Rising Sun (novel)|Rising Sun'' in 1992. In this case, Clancy avoided  " Japan bashing "  that is evident in Crichton's work, and instead presented a balanced picture of Culture of Japan|Japanese society, its Government of Japan|government, business practices, and values. In the novel, he also discussed currency trading, governmental corruption, Automotive industry in Japan|car manufacturing and distribution, and power politics in the country.    
 
 The novel also reinforces Clancy's belief that the recent downsizing of the military establishment after the Cold War  " has so depleted our military resources that the country is vulnerable to aggression that can arise anywhere, anytime " , according to ''Publishers Weekly''s review of the book.    
 
 ==Reception== 
 The novel received positive reviews. Publishers Weekly praised Clancy, who  " spins out story threads in a rich but bewildering tangle of plot and setting, then vigorously weaves them together. Here, the heart-stopping climax is unexpected, but oddly appropriate. "  However, Christopher Buckley (novelist)|Christopher Buckley, in a review for ''The New York Times'', called the book a  " herniating experience "  and criticized its  " racist "  depictions of Japanese characters.    
 
 ==Legacy== 
 In later years, the novel was noted for its similarity to the circumstances surrounding United Airlines Flight 93, especially regarding its climax, where an embittered Japanese pilot crashes his 747 on a joint session of Congress in the Capitol. While researching for the novel's ending, Clancy consulted an Air Force officer and described his reaction:  " I ran this idea past him and all of a sudden this guy's eyeballing me rather closely and I said, 'Come on General, I know you must have looked at this before, you've got to have a plan for it.'  And the guy goes, 'Mr. Clancy, to the best of my knowledge, if we had a plan to deal with this, it would be secret, I wouldn't be able to talk to you about it, but to the best of my knowledge we've never looked at this possibility before.' "    
 
 On April 1995, United States senator Sam Nunn outlined a scenario similar to the novel's ending, in which terrorists attack the Capitol on the night of a State of the Union address by crashing a radio-controlled airplane filled with chemical weapons into it. Nunn concluded that the scenario is  " not far-fetched "  and that the required technology is readily available.     However, the 9/11 Commission Report revealed that national security officials did not consider the possibility: “[Counterterror official] Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke told us that he was concerned about the danger posed by aircraft in the context of protecting the 1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta Olympics of 1996, the White House complex, and the 2001 G-8 summit in Genoa. But he attributed his awareness more to Tom Clancy novels than to warnings from the intelligence community.”    
 
 In the aftermath of the attacks, Clancy was called into CNN and commented on the similarity between a plane crash depicted in the novel and the crash of United Flight 93. CNN anchor Judy Woodruff later remarked:  " People in our newsroom have been saying today that what is happening is like right out of a Tom Clancy novel. "
