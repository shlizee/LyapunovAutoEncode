Friedman, accompanied by a ten-part series broadcast on public television, that advocates free market principles. It was primarily a response to an earlier landmark book and television series ''The Age of Uncertainty'', by the noted economist John Kenneth Galbraith. Milton Friedman won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1976. 
 
 ==Overview== 
 ''Free to Choose: A Personal Statement'' maintains that the free market works best for all members of a society, provides examples of how the free market engenders prosperity, and maintains that it can solve problems where other approaches have failed. Published in January 1980, the 297 page book contains 10 chapters. The book was on the United States best sellers list for 5 weeks. 
 
 Public Broadcasting Service|PBS broadcast the programs, beginning in January 1980. It was filmed at the invitation of Robert Chitester, the owner of WQLN (TV)|WQLN-TV. It was based on a 15-part series of taped public lectures and question-and-answer sessions. The general format was that of Milton Friedman visiting and narrating a number of success and failure stories in history, which he attributes to free-market capitalism or the lack thereof (e.g., Hong Kong is commended for its free markets, while India is excoriated for relying on centralized planning especially for its protectionism|protection of its traditional textile industry). Following the primary show, Friedman would engage in discussion moderated by Robert McKenzie (psephologist)|Robert McKenzie with a number of selected debaters drawn from trade unions, academy and the business community, such as Donald Rumsfeld (then of G.D. Searle  &  Company) and Frances Fox Piven of City University of New York. The interlocutors would offer objections to or support for the proposals put forward by Friedman, who would in turn respond. After the final episode, Friedman sat down for an interview with Lawrence E. Spivak|Lawrence Spivak. 
 
 The series was rebroadcast in 1990 with Linda Chavez moderating the episodes. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ronald Reagan, Steve Allen and George Shultz give personal introductions for each episode. This time, after the documentary part, Friedman sits down with a single opponent to debate the issues raised in the episode.

 ==Positions advocated== 
 The Friedmans advocate ''laissez-faire'' economic policies, often criticizing Interventionism (politics)|interventionist government policies and their cost in personal freedoms and economic efficiency in the United States and abroad. They argue that international free trade has been restricted through Tariff|tariffs and protectionism while domestic free trade and freedom have been limited through high taxation and regulation. They cite the 19th-century United Kingdom, the United States before the Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression, and modern Hong Kong as ideal examples of a minimalist economic policy. They contrast the Economic history of Japan|economic growth of Japan after the Meiji Restoration and the economic stagnation of India after its independence from the British Empire, and argue that India has performed worse despite its superior economic potential due to its centralized planning. They argue that even countries with Planned economy|command economies, including the Soviet Union and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia, have been forced to adopt limited market mechanisms in order to operate. The authors argue against government Fuel tax|taxation on gas and Tobacco tax|tobacco and government regulation of the public school systems. The Friedmans argue that the Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve exacerbated the Great Depression by neglecting to prevent the decline of the money supply in the years leading up to it. They further argue that the American public falsely perceived the Depression to be a result of a failure of capitalism rather than the government, and that the Depression allowed the Federal Reserve Board of Governors|Federal Reserve Board to centralize its control of the monetary system despite its responsibility for it.  
 
 On the subject of Welfare state|welfare, the Friedmans argue that the United States has maintained a higher degree of freedom and productivity by avoiding the Nationalization|nationalizations and extensive welfare systems of Western Europe|Western European countries such as the Welfare state in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom and Sweden. However, they also argue that welfare practices since the New Deal under  " the United States Department of Health and Human Services#Department of Health, Education, and Welfare|HEW empire "  have been harmful. They argue that Social programs in the United States|public assistance programs have become larger than originally envisioned and are creating  " wards of the state "  as opposed to  " self-reliant individuals. "  They also argue that the Social Security (United States)|Social Security System is fundamentally flawed, that urban renewal and public housing programs have contributed to Racial inequality in the United States|racial inequality and diminished quality of low-income housing, and that Medicare (United States)|Medicare and Medicaid are responsible for rising healthcare prices in the United States. They suggest completely replacing the welfare state with a negative income tax as a less harmful alternative.  
 
 The Friedmans also argue that declining academic performance in the United States is the result of increasing government control of the Education in the United States|American education system tracing back to the 1840s, but suggest a School voucher|voucher system as a politically feasible solution. They blame the 1973–1975 recession|1970s recession and lower quality of consumer goods on extensive business regulations since the 1960s, and advocate abolishing the Food and Drug Administration, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|Consumer Product Safety Commission, Amtrak, and Conrail. They argue that the 1970s energy crisis|energy crisis would be resolved by abolishing the United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy and Price floor|price floors on Petroleum|crude oil. They recommend replacing the United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency and Environmental policy of the United States|environmental regulation with an Ecotax|effluent charge. They criticize Trade union|labor unions for raising prices and lowering Law of demand|demand by enforcing high wage levels, and for contributing to Unemployment in the United States|unemployment by limiting jobs. They argue that inflation is caused by excessive government spending, the Federal Reserve's attempts to control Interest rate|interest rates, and full employment policy. They call for tighter control of Fed money supply despite the fact that it will result in a temporary period of high unemployment and low growth due to the interruption of the Price/wage spiral|wage-price spiral. In the final chapter, they take note of recent current events that seem to suggest a return to free-market principles in academic thought and public opinion, and argue in favor of an  " economic Bill of rights|Bill of Rights "  to cement the changes.
