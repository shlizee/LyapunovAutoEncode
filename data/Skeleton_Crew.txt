 ==Overview== 
 The collection features 22 works, which includes nineteen short stories, a novella ( " The Mist " ), and two poems ( " Paranoid: A Chant "  and  " For Owen " ). In addition to the introduction, in which King directly addresses his readers in his signature conversational style, ''Skeleton Crew'' features an epilogue of sorts entitled  " Notes "  wherein King discusses the origins of several stories in the collection. The stories are collected from science-fiction and horror anthologies (''Dark Forces'', ''Shadows'', ''Terrors'', and ''New Terrors''), genre magazine publications (''The Twilight Zone Magazine|Twilight Zone'', ''Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine'', ''Startling Mystery Stories'', ''Weirdbook'' and ''The Magazine of Fantasy  &  Science Fiction|Fantasy and Science Fiction''), and popular magazines (''Redbook'', ''Gallery (magazine)|Gallery'', ''Yankee Magazine|Yankee'' and ''Playboy (magazine)|Playboy''). 
 
 Although published in 1985, the stories collected in ''Skeleton Crew'' span seventeen years from  " The Reaper's Image "  (King's second professional sale when he was just eighteen years old) to  " The Ballad of The Flexible Bullet "  which was completed in 1983.  King, Stephen,  " Introduction "  to ''Skeleton Crew'', Putnam Press 1985 pp. & nbsp;13  
 
 ''Skeleton Crew'' is critically held as showing King as a maturing writer  Beahm, George, ''The Stephen King Companion'', Andrews and McNeel, 1989, pp. & nbsp;271   with greater breadth and depth than his previous short works.  Collings, Michael R., ''The Annotated Guide to Stephen King'', Starmount Press, 1986, pp. & nbsp;25  
 
 The collection also features some more personal works, including  " For Owen " , the poem he wrote for his son, and  " Gramma "  a horrific tale from an eleven-year-old boy's perspective that seems to recall King's own horrors living with his invalid grandmother.

 Of one of the stories in the collection, King says:  " As far as short stories are concerned, I like the grisly ones the best. However the story  " Survivor Type "  goes a little bit too far, even for me. "  Grant, Charles L.  " Interview with Stephen King  "  Monsterland Magazine, May/June, 1985.
