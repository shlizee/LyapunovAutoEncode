 ==Plot summary== 
 
  
  
 
 Weird starts out in the Ferguslie Park area of Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley in a very underprivileged Catholic family. He is impressed by a group named Frozen Gold when he sees them live, in the Union of University of Paisley|Paisley College of Technology, and auditions with them. Christine Brice likes his songs, and he joins the band. He ends up writing all their material and playing bass guitar (after trying unsuccessfully to get them to change their name), as the band rises in the Psychoactive drug|drug- and Alcoholic beverage|booze-fuelled rock and roll of the 1970s, assisted by A & R man Rick Tumber of ARC Records. In the Three Chimneys tour, singer Davey Balfour takes Dan along on an attempt to break an unofficial (and illegal) speed record for flying around three power station chimneys in Kent in his private aeroplane. 
 
 He reminisces about this from 1980s Glasgow, where he lives as a recluse in a Victorian folly (St Jutes), ever since the tragic events which led to the demise of the band. He is posing as his own caretaker, and his friends McCann and Wee Tommy know him as Jimmy Hay. After a memorable fight in a nightclub called 'Monty's', his real identity is revealed. He has grown uncomfortable with fame and wealth, and eventually visits his first girlfriend, Jean Webb, now living in Arisaig. 
 
 ==Literary significance  &  criticism== 
 The band is loosely modelled on Pink Floyd or Fleetwood Mac although Banks has said that the character of Weird was in part inspired by Fish (singer)|Fish, the ex-Marillion singer and lyricist ( " When I created Weird [...] I think Fish was at the back of my mind as a wee subliminal influence " ).  Iain Banks  &  Fish,  " How We Met " , ''The Independent'', 25 April 1999, retrieved 12 March 2012 [   Sex, drugs and rock and roll are present on almost every page, sometimes all three at once. There is a tone of rock journalism in the parts of the book about Frozen Gold. Coincidentally, onetime aspiring rock musician Sandy Robertson, who later became a well known rock journalist at Sounds magazine, lived in Espedair Street in the early 70s before the book was written.  
 
 As Banks' first novel to eschew 'special effects', not being gothic novel|Gothic horror fiction|horror like ''The Wasp Factory'', a literary mystery fiction|mystery like ''Walking on Glass'', or science fiction like ''The_Bridge_(novel)|The Bridge'', most critics regard it as one of his most accessible works.  
 
 Espedair Street is also a real street in Charleston, Paisley, where some of the significant events in the book take place.
