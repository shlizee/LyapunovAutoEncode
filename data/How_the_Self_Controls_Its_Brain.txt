Eccles, ''How the Self Controls its Brain'', Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 1994. .   is a book by John Carew Eccles|Sir John Eccles, proposing a theory of philosophical Mind-body dualism|dualism, and offering a justification of how there can be mind-brain action without violating the principle of the conservation of energy. The model was developed jointly with the nuclear physicist Friedrich Beck in the period 1991â€“1992.          
 
 Eccles called the fundamental neural units of the cerebral cortex '' " dendrons " '', which are Cortical column|cylindrical bundles of neurons arranged vertically in the six outer Cerebral cortex#Laminar pattern|layers or laminae of the cortex, each cylinder being about 60 micrometres in diameter.  Eccles proposed that each of the 40 million dendrons is linked with a mental unit, or '' " psychon " '', representing a unitary consciousness|conscious experience. In willed actions and thought, psychons act on dendrons and, for a moment, increase the probability of the firing of selected neurons through quantum tunneling effect in synapse|synaptic exocytosis, while in perception the reverse process takes place.
